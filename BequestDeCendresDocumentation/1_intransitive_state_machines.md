## Intransitive State Machine
The bulk of the main gameplay, which may evolve into a battle system, is based on intransitive states between Lure, Stun, and Trap.

The mechanics themselves are based on rock-paper-scissors. When you get game over, the gameplay switches to hangman. And that's how you prevent gameovers.
