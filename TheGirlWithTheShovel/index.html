<h2 id="timetravelershandbooktoserialmurder">Time Travelers Handbook To Serial Murder</h2>
<p>"Otis, what did I tell you about," The boss looked at the clock. "waiting around twiddling your thumbs?"</p>

<p>"Sorry sir, I'll make sure it doesn't happen again."</p>

<p>"Make sure of that."</p>

<p>"Yes sir."</p>

<p>"Oh! look at the time. You can leave now."</p>

<p>It was nine o'clock, and Otis exited the door. He moved a couple of years ago to the port town. He walked along the sidewalk, and the cars are passed him by. He dropped by the nearest convenience store.</p>

<p>Otis picked out a beer from the freezer.</p>

<p>Otis is in the kitchen, with the dinner he prepared for his girlfriend. It became slightly impatient because she was not yet home. He decided to call his girlfriend on his cell phone.</p>

<p>"Hun, what the hell is taking you so long?" Otis said.</p>

<p>"Are you lying?" Naomi Said.</p>

<p>"Scratch it, how about I make dinner tonight?" Otis was watching television. It was the news channel. A liberal news network. "We could have wine too."</p>

<p>"Sounds awesome."</p>

<p>"Later baby."</p>

<p>Otis hung up his cell phone, and placed it in his pants pocket. He walked to his computer He thought Something doesn't seem right about this girl, this is the second time she's late. His girlfriend would always came home with a box of Kahlua chocolate truffles.</p>

<p>The second hour went by. He thought What the hell is taking so long?</p>

<p>Otis had a picture of Brian in his head, and he winced, because he remembered when Brian hit on him. He sat at the table, eating his dinner, and he drank a sip of his wine.</p>

<p>"Nah, I got to be kidding myself," Otis switched the channel to another network. "why can't I be more trusting?" Otis took a long deep look into the screen, as he sat on the couch. "She didn't seem like a slut. I can't put my mind around it."</p>

<p>Otis hopped off the couch, and took out his cell phone, and then opened his cell phone to call his girlfriend.</p>

<p>"What's taking so long?" Otis asked.</p>

<p>"I'm on my way home, I just had to make a stop." Naomi said.</p>

<p>"I'm starting to regret offering to cook dinner." Otis clenched his fist. "It's getting late, and I'm hungry."</p>

<p>"Just make dinner for yourself tonight."</p>

<p>Otis traveled along the icy road to see his girlfriend, and he narrowly avoided a collision with a car.</p>

<p>He arrived to the apartment.</p>

<p>He walked to the door, and knocked on it. Otis put his ear up to the door, and could hear the whistle of air conditioning on the inside. He opens the door knob, and noticed it was unlocked.</p>

<p>The door creaked. And then he heard a murmurs, a man and a woman.</p>

<p>"What was that?"</p>

<p>"Oh don't worry about it Hun, just go nice and slow."</p>

<p>Otis walked slowly to his girlfriends bedroom door, and then he bursted the door open. It was her giving the man a blow job. Otis spoke.</p>

<p>"What the hell is this?"</p>

<p>"Its not what you think Otis!"</p>

<p>"Who is this?" The other man said.</p>

<p>"I'm know one you'll ever see again."</p>

<p>Otis locked the door of his apartment, when he got back home. He went to go lye down on the couch.</p>

<p>Otis thought Why would she do this to me!? Did I ever hit her, or otherwise abuse her!? No, it wasn't like that at all.</p>

<p>He drowned in all his sorrows with a glass of merlot, and then sat on the couch to watch the news.</p>

<p>Tonight's topic was about an arsonist that died in a fire. The other story was about a WWIII couple that proposed after the war.</p>

<p>Otis turned the LCD monitor off, and clapped the lights out. He went to his room to sleep. He could not sleep for a minute.</p>

<p>He briefly thought about his life up to now.</p>

<p>Otis had a dream.</p>

<p>The sky was a late evening blue, waves crashed along the shoreline. A viking long house was along the shore. It was the year 1056</p>

<p>There was a single room cabin. Benches were used as both beds and seats. Along the walls you could see the dried meat hanging from the walls.</p>

<p>Arnbjorn woke up to get his fishing gear.</p>

<p>He saw Halldora, who appeared behind him.</p>

<p>"What are you doing up this early Hally?"</p>

<p>"Dad, I'm tired of having to weave and crochet all the time." Halldora played with his long blond hair. "Could I go fishing with you sometime?</p>

<p>"You should get your priorities straight." He grimaced sternly. "Your job is to help your mother maintain the household. Maybe when you're a little older I might change my mind. You will just be swept away by the waves anyway."</p>

<p>She pictured herself reeling in the fish, and cooking a wonderful meal for the whole family.</p>

<p>"I just wanted to be like you daddy, is that to much to ask."</p>

<p>"Just go back to sleep."</p>

<p>"If you could even work for two whole days, someday I might consider taking you with me. I will think about it.</p>

<p>Arnbjorn left the cabin.</p>

<p>At the fish shop, Halldora's father was tending to a customer.</p>

<p>"It only costs 50 Krona to buy this fish!?" He said.</p>

<p>"Only fifty, that's more than I earn in a week!" The customer said.</p>

<p>"If you don't like it, go elsewhere. But I bet your wont fish anywhere near this good."</p>

<p>To the contrary, he would often time sell rotten fish preserved with salt on the open market, and advertise it as if it were fresh.</p>

<p>It was a dishonest profession, but times were hard. But at least he always saved the freshest of seafood for his family.</p>

<p>Arnbjorn is sea fishing with his best friend.</p>

<p>"Hook, line, and sinker." Arnbjorn said.</p>

<p>"You really should let your daughter bond with you more."</p>

<p>"But what better way to bond than to talk about viking voyages second hand?" Arnbjorn was being facetious. "About how wonderful gathering the wood is."</p>

<p>Arnbjorn came around and let her go sea fishing with him.</p>

<p>As he had predicted, she was swept up by the waves.</p>

<p>"You're a disgrace to our family." He said.</p>

<p>He left her out to drown in the cold, windy ocean.</p>

<p>"Daddy!! Come back."</p>

<p>She tried swimming to locate his boat, and mustered all the strength she could summon. But no boat.</p>

<p>"Dad!? How could you?"</p>

<p>The morning dawn shined dimly, Otis woke up from the dream. He is breathing in and out with major heaving after being deprived of oxygen briefly.</p>

<p>Otis had something to eat, but decided to get breakfast out.</p>

<p>He walked to work.</p>

<p>In real time in the real past, Halldora at first sank into the water, and swam to shore. She arrived at home wet.</p>

<p>She woke up on her bench she happened to use for a bed that night. The mother asked her daughter a question.</p>

<p>"What happened to your face hun?"</p>

<p>"Me and dad were in a bad fight, just ignore it."</p>

<p>"Is this going to be how it is?"</p>

<p>Back in the present time.</p>

<p>Otis got a job as a lab technician after quitting his first job. He had built up enough university credits to work as a scientists assistant.</p>

<p>The person supervising him was Machida Kayo, and part time professor, and part time drill sergeant</p>

<p>Machida relaxed with a nice cold beer, while spouting off commands at Otis.</p>

<p>"So I assume you got the dark matter?" Machida said.</p>

<p>"Roger."</p>

<p>Otis handed Machida the dark matter, and then asked the monitor, "What time is it computer?"</p>

<p>"It is now 13:05 hours." The computer said.</p>

<p>"Are you ready to change history."</p>

<p>"Roger."</p>

<p>Machida fired the engine, and the machines sparked, and caused the whole lab to warp. He tried to get Otis out.</p>

<p>Otis blacked out.</p>

<p>He warped his spaceship into Viking time.</p>

<p>Otis crashed his ship.</p>

<p>Otis was awoken, and flew out of the ship. He slapped into a tree. And then he got up injured. He had a loose tooth.</p>

<p>"This doesn't look like the Andromeda galaxy."</p>

<p>It looked like he was in some forest.</p>

<p>"Well Machi Macho did mention worm-holes were unpredictable were they might end up."</p>

<p>Otis tried reporting his current situation.</p>

<p>While tending to her sheep on the farm, a girl saw a huge explosion in the distance.</p>

<p>She directed her sheep back to the farm.</p>

<p>A charred black otis is leaning into the mic, and he tried to call back Machida. But no answer, so he crawled to the village.</p>

<p>He collapsed when he reached the town square. The villagers looked at him like he were a demon.</p>

<p>Otis woke up, and found himself lying on a bench. The house was pretty much one long room.</p>

<p>"Talk about living it up." Otis picked his nose. "What year did I warp into?"</p>

<p>An older man, and a younger girl in what looked like Norse outfits opened the door. They hurried to close the door before the cool settled in.</p>

<p>"Now hold on a sec poppa, who's that guy."</p>

<p>"I found this girly man." Arnbjorn said. He took off his non horned helmet. "I figured something must have been up, so I took him in."</p>

<p>"I say we kill him."</p>

<p>"Nah, I got a better idea. If he's going to stay for a while, ..."</p>

<p>"He might as well be useful!"</p>

<p>"So were did you come from?"</p>

<p>"The orient." They missed the joke, because they focused on his bizarre clothing. It was a streamlined spaceman suit.</p>

<p>"Me and Halldora are going sea fishing." Arnbjorn said.</p>

<p>"Now make yourself useful and gather some firewood." Halldora said.</p>

<p>They exit the house.</p>

<p>Otis snuck out of the house early in the morning.</p>

<p>He could here villagers cursing at his ship as if it were the product of the fire god himself. So he had to go see what was going on.</p>

<p>The villagers were attacking his ship, and had no choice but to self destruct the ship.</p>

<p>This killed the farmers instantly.</p>

<p>He found a small cottage not unlike the house he stayed in the previous night. He knocked on the door.</p>

<p>What what looked like a lady in her late 20's, greeted him.</p>

<p>"How may I help you?" Otis said.</p>

<p>"This is urgent, and I need someone to hear me out."</p>

<p>"What do you need?"</p>

<p>"I have no idea what happened." Otis coughed, residue from the engine explosion was still lingering on his face. "But there was some kind of bug in the dark matter engine. I somehow landed here. I was suppose to land in the Andromeda galaxy. Do you know of any hardware stores around here?"</p>

<p>Otis did not watch the science fiction movies, or he would have known better.</p>

<p>Or maybe he still did not think he was in normal time, and just landed in some primitive place in Europe.</p>

<p>"Wait what?" The Nordic lady said.</p>

<p>"What year is it?" Otis asked.</p>

<p>"This is the year 1040."</p>

<p>She let him come in and get some rest.</p>

<p>Halldora came by that house, and knocked on her neighbors door.</p>

<p>"Excuse me, have you seen a young trell around this part."</p>

<p>"Why yes, he said something about.."</p>

<p>One of Halldora's slaves tried to drag Otis out of the cabin, and he tried to hold them off. Then Halldora blew a sleeping dart at his neck.</p>

<p>He blacked out once more. He woke up to find he was tied to one of their benches.</p>

<p>"You think you got it bad, yar trell. I normally give ye 700." Arnbjorn said. He whipped up a storm on Otis's back.</p>

<p>He once again had to gather wood for Halldora's father.</p>

<p>When he got up, he slowly and carefully made as little noise as possible. He saw Arnbjorn outside, and snuck up behind him.</p>

<p>He strangled him, till he passed out. Otis was not aware the next morning the man would be dead.</p>

<p>He then jogged over to the snitching ladies house.</p>

<p>Otis knocked on the door.</p>

<p>"What brings you here. You have some kind of letter. Indicating your master sent you?" Otis said.</p>

<p>He took out the note he forged, and she let him intending to once again wait till Halldora or her father came to take him back.</p>

<p>"So who are you really?"</p>

<p>"I am,...a jackass, a bastard child, and an illegitimate prick." The lady wasn't aware that he was joking.</p>

<p>Otis was able to charm her enough to lure her to bed, and he slipped in some sleeping pills in her drink that he packed for long trips.</p>

<p>She slept like a rock,</p>

<p>Otis talked to Machida on his repaired cell phone while hiding in the Viking village. The hardware hacking handbook finally came in handy.</p>

<p>"Hey Machida, you won't believe where I ended up."</p>

<p>"Otis, I didn't mean for you to literally change history."</p>

<p>"Very funny. Now how am I going to get home?"</p>

<p>"Look behind you."</p>

<p>Otis thought he heard a chuckle he recognized, and turned around.</p>

<p>"How did you get here Henry."</p>

<p>"Machida had a few issues regarding the system."</p>

<p>"Henry is going to give you a ride, and then I'll give you the new briefing." Machida laughed madly at his stupid pun, and then hung up his cell phone.</p>

<p>"So he sent me to come rescue your ass. Thank me later." Henry said.</p>

<p>"I was watching you the previous days," Henry took out his hand gun for self defence. "To see if you could handle yourself."</p>

<p>"You prick! Thanks for rescuing me!"</p>

<p>"Oh about that, my ship broke down."</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>Otis Makes Dreams A few months later.</p>

<p>Otis picked out a beer from the freezer when he was in the kitchen, with the dinner he prepared for the evening on a plate on the table. He could smell the stir fry of slaw makings, kielbasa, and thinly sliced chicken wafting into his priggish nose. He then shook about with the jitters, and tossed the phone onto the floor, because Leila was not yet home. So he decided to call his girlfriend – at least at the present – on his cell phone. He opened the lid slowly, and then the lights from the buttons flickered.</p>

<p>"Hun, the hell is taken so long?" he said.</p>

<p>"Are you lying? I'm working late tonight." Naomi Said.</p>

<p>"Scratch it, how about I make dinner later tonight?" Otis was watching television as he was speaking to Leila the bubble gum popper. It was the news channel. "We could have wine too."</p>

<p>"Sounds awesome." Leila said.</p>

<p>"Later baby."</p>

<p>Otis hung up his cell phone slowly, and then placed down upon the table still slightly shaken up, as he was not sure whether she would be home tonight. Then walked to his computer. He at that moment thought something doesn't seem right about the woman, the second time she's been late that week. I hope it really is she is working late, he thought. Leila would always came home with a box of chocolate truffles, so for the two. ... "Just for the two off right?"</p>

<p>But after the hours went by, he ate his stir fry alone.</p>

<p>He thought What the hell is taking so long?</p>

<p>Otis had no reason to suspect Brian, although part of him suspected he was involved because of how he his employer always commented on how she was a good lady to him. Suspected how he only kept the job, because of a close connection to his bubble gum popping late girlfriend. He sat at the table, and drank the last of his wine. It was a minor comfort for him, a taste of sweetness amongst the bitterness. "Nah, I got to be kidding myself," Otis got up to switch the channel to another network. "why can't I be more trusting?"</p>

<p>Otis took a long deep look into the screen, as sat on the couch. "Didn't seem like a slut when I first met her. I don't know man." And then he reclined back. Otis hopped off the couch, and took out his cell phone to call his girlfriend. "What's taking so long?"</p>

<p>"I'm on my way home, I just had to make a stop." Naomi said.</p>

<p>What stop might that be, Otis thought. "I'm starting to regret offering to cook dinner." Otis clenched his fist. "It's getting late, and I'm hungry."</p>

<p>"Just make dinner for yourself tonight." Leila said.</p>

<p>It the was second Wednesday that Otis arrived to the apartment on an invitation, and arrived at the door to knock on it. "You can go ahead and come in." He heard Leila said. He opens the door knob, and noticed it was unlocked. The door creaked. And then he heard a murmur, a man and a woman. "What was that?" He heard Brian's voice say.</p>

<p>"Oh don't worry about it Hun, just go nice and slow."</p>

<p>Otis then walked slowly to his girlfriends bedroom door, and did not really want to wait here long, as he wanted to take a long vacation away from the city. Away from the old working life. She said he come in.</p>

<p>Leila was giving Brian a blow job.</p>

<p>"Bey! Otis, hows it going man!?" Brain said.</p>

<p>"I'm good you?" Otis said, and walked out of the door abruptly. Slammed the door shut at his apartment, locked the door of his apartment wanting to cover the entrance with the type of wood that you would make a swing set out of. Then went to go lye down on the couch. Could not resist the killer thought of Brain the slouch. Ouch, what a fucking slouch Brian, Otis thought. Why would Leila do this to me!? And drowned in all his sorrows, with another glass of wine while sitting down on the couch to watch the news. For at this point even the news of the generic variety was good company for the post grad.</p>

<p>He thought its never going to be the same. Never going to be the same all.</p>

<p>Tonight the topic was about an arsonist that died in a fire. The other story was about a WWIII couple that proposed after the war. Either story was one that he would ordinarily abhor, but anything was good at this point.</p>

<p>After turning the LCD monitor off, he clapped the lights out on the lamp. Went to his room to sleep. Through himself down on the cover, like a champ. And for moment, he felt like he was being fried by jumper cables.</p>

<p>He briefly thought about his life up to now.</p>

<p>And plugged himself into the pod-net. He loaded up an old video game he downloaded when they first met, how they used to game together. She would always lead the pack, he was the one instructed to tack together the puzzle pieces of electronic life. He saw the sky was a late evening blue, with the waves crashing along the shoreline. A Norman long house was along the shore. He felt he must have hallucinated that it was the year 1456. But it did not matter, he would go medieval on what ever creatures existed in the meshwork.</p>

<p>As he played his game, he tried to fend off a tall Nordic man who was chasing after him with his sword. And after he was struck, everything faded to darkness. Game over for this particular bloke. It slowly came back, there was a single room cabin. Benches were used as both beds and seats, and along the walls you could see the dried meat hanging from the walls. Arnbjorn woke up to get his fishing gear.</p>

<p>Otis saw Halldora, who appeared behind him.</p>

<p>"What are you doing up this early Hally?" He heard the tall man say to his little girl, but he did not care. Wondered why the non horned helmet man did not just decide to scalp his dream-space avatar, and get it over with. "Dad, I'm tired of having to weave and crochet all the time." Halldora played with her long blond hair.</p>

<p>"Could I go fishing with you sometime?" Halldora said.</p>

<p>"You should get your priorities straight." He grimaced sternly. "Your job is to help your mother maintain the household. Ouch man, and Leila thought I was little shit. That guy is a really tall shit eater, Otis thought trying to pretend like he was still asleep so as not to attract notice. "Maybe when you're a little older I might change my mind. You will just be swept away by the waves anyway."</p>

<p>At the fish shop, Halldora's father was tending to a customer along with the new slave that had recently logged into the meshwork. Just you wait old electronic think, I will beat the level out of you like you won't believe, Otis thought. "It only costs 50 Krona to buy this fish!?" Arnbjorn said to the customer.</p>

<p>"Only fifty! ... More than I earn in a week!" The customer said, who walked over to the other fisherman's shop.</p>

<p>"Yea that's right if you don't like it, go elsewhere. But I bet your wont fish anywhere near this good." He would often time sell rotten fish preserved with salt on the open market, and advertise it as if it were fresh. A dishonest profession, but times were hard. But at least he always saved the freshest of seafood for his family. They would be none the wiser.</p>

<p>Arnbjorn is sea fishing with his Otis the avatar.</p>

<p>"Hook, line, and sinker." Arnbjorn said.</p>

<p>"You really should let your daughter bond with you more." Otis said.</p>

<p>"But what better way to bond than to talk about voyages second hand?" Arnbjorn was being of course not being serious. "About how wonderful gathering the wood is."</p>

<p>Arnbjorn came around and let her go sea fishing with him.</p>

<p>As he had predicted, she was swept up by the waves.</p>

<p>"You're a disgrace to our family." He said.</p>

<p>"Your a disgrace for a father." Otis said, and pushed him into the ocean, and carefully made sure so a to only retrieve Halldora in order to keep her from drowning in the waves that tasted of salt.</p>

<p>"Daddy!! Come back." Halldora the AI said.</p>

<p>"That dad was going to let you drown." Otis said.</p>

<p>"Dad!? How could you?" —</p>

<p>— Otis woke up from the dream. He breathed in and out with major heaving after being deprived of oxygen briefly. He walked to the kitchen to have something to eat, but decided to get breakfast out.</p>

<p>But eventually the plug in system back at home, begin to behave peculiarly. Halldora at first sank into the water. But the water from the console evaporated, and she was lying down upon the carpet.</p>

<p>"Where am I?" Halldora said. Looked up, her perception of Heaven. But instead he was merely, an introduction to the twenty first century. "Is this going to be how it is? Will I not be able to get home?"</p>

<p>Machida Kayo, and part time professor of fixing the console devices, and a part time drill sergeant. He always loved yelling at his clientel, who would rather pay someone else. But could not afford anybody cheaper. He relaxed with a nice cold beer, while spouting off questions about the living girl avatar in his room. "So I assume you have the adoption papers?" Machida said.</p>

<p>Otis stared at the little AI. "Maybe."</p>

<p>"It is now 13:05 hours." A computer generated voice said, that was coming from the desktop hologram projector. Machida fixed the console, and the machine sparked back to life. It was alive again, would be Otis's wife.</p>

<p>Otis and Halldora plugged in.</p>

<p>Played another game of pop goes the Viking. But Otis instead forgot about the fact that each world generated a new world. And dear Halldora, alone in the world with him. Would never see her family again. Otis is awoken, and flew out of the ship that crashed. Halldora held on to the seat of the space ship, and it slammed into a tree. Otis got up injured, and began to limp just a little bit.</p>

<p>"This doesn't look like the Andromeda galaxy, that for sure." It looked like he was in some forest. "Well Machi Macho did mention worm-holes were unpredictable were they might end up." Otis tried reporting his current situation to his mechanic. But the young pink hair mechanic man, would not answer his cell phone as a charred black otis is leaned into the mic, and tried to call back Machida.</p>

<p>He called for Halldora, hoping she was still alive.</p>

<p>Halldora popped out from the pop. "Here I am."</p>

<p>I wonder if the new network erased her memories, Otis thought. And then he collapsed when he reached the town square. The villagers looked at him like he were a demon.</p>

<p>An older man that looked like Arnbjorn from the world before, and two versions of Halldora in their white night gowns. They hurried to close the door before the cool settled in.</p>

<p>"Now hold on a sec poppa, who's that guy."</p>

<p>"Halldora two, that's our now buckaroo."</p>

<p>"I say we kill him."</p>

<p>Otis logged out of freight. —</p>

<p>And he could hear voices.</p>

<p>"Nah, I got a better idea. If he's going to stay for a while, ..."</p>

<p>"He might as well be useful!"</p>

<p>"So were did he come from?"</p>

<p>"The orient." Otis said, crying himself to sleep. Knowing that his little girl he tried to save from the old save file would not here him.</p>

<h2 id="indigospacers">Indigo Spacers</h2>

<p>1 — Nikko — So I attempted to read my assigned reading for my uni class, while Jerid blasted tunes into my poor ear drums on his computer monitor.</p>

<p>I wanted this to stop. So I got off his bed – I always visited on any lonely night – shaking in an irritable movement. And in doing so I carried the pillow from the bed, and was just about to make a move as if I were going to throw the pillow at him. But it was then I found. ... That he was being entertained by something else at the computer. That he was in his own little world. Someplace far away, that would be impossible for me to pop him out of. So I went back to the bed, resisting the dance to the music as I went.</p>

<p>“If you could turn the music off,” I said. Then hopped back onto the bed. It was jiggly, like a water bed. “for just one minute.”</p>

<p>“Of course I will Nik-Nak,” Jerid said. I could tell he was barely paying attention to whatever it was I was saying. “I just need to finish these tunes.” He turned the volume, ... way down. I relaxed until ... “Then maybe, I can study with you. Maybe?” Then shot it way up. I jumped and rolled over.</p>

<p>Irritated, I got off of the bed. Then tried to turn off the computer. He was like a frig-gin jack rabbit man. “Hey Nikko, relax.” He was to preoccupied at staring at his computer monitor, than staring at poor me. “Our friend Avon, is going to be here soon. Then I will show him some science.” He made sure to say that, in a very deep voice. ... Oh yea. He then let go of me slowly, keeping a watchful eye on me, to make sure she didn’t pull a fast one.</p>

<p>After we stared at each other for just about a min, I decided to stick my tongue out at him. It was like sibling rivalry, but with two love birds. With a stone tossed at them. And so my concentration for that evening, was shot through the roof. “Fine, but I won’t help you with your grades.” I said, referencing what he said earlier like a smart ass.</p>

<p>“Fine by me.” I thought he normally, loved to study with me. ... Fuck him.</p>

<p>You know who bursted through the dorm door, causing me to jump ... – and fell on my face.Ow-ie! And then I could feel the footsteps of his synthetic sports boots walk by me into the dimly lit dorm room. I looked up his his short buzzed blond hair. His hair had a slightly green tint because of the blue of the screen. It was then I heard his voice. “So how’s it going Jay-Rod? Find anything new?” That voice irritated me every time, he sounded like such a winer sometimes you know?</p>

<p>“I found this cool toolkit online,” I heard Jerid say. Oh that bastard somehow sounded more excited now. I could see his smile like a madman, at the flicker of the hologram monitor which shined a stung my poor eyes. “it’s this strange government tech.” He felt like doing this happy dance, but I guess he decided against it. After all he didn’t want to indicate he was more thrilled being around whiney voiced Avon boy. Fuck him. Fuck it all.</p>

<p>I carefully got up, and scrubbed off my purple sports coat. Not so stylish, but it suits me just fine. So get over it. Anyway, so I was saying. I heard Avon say, before he turned around to face the door behind me, “Your not doing anything, to get us watched are you?”</p>

<p>“No of course not,” I heard Jerid say. Then his eye spasm-ed on the computer screen. “Well, at least not on purpose. I got the chemical composition in the fridge. That part of it is taken care of.”</p>

<p>So I saw Avon walk over the fridge, and he opened it up. The glow from inside the mini-fridge gave the dorm, a few milliseconds of normal light in the room. That crucial moment that stang my eyes even more than that god damn fall man. I just barely saw him try to pick up the bottle, discretely. But as always Jerid motioned his open hand downward.</p>

<p>“Avon, lower that thing. You were the one asking,” Jerid said. Then stopped his hand suddenly in mid air. “if I was trying to do anything to get us watched.”</p>

<p>“But Jerid, I’m bored.” —</p>

<p>2 — Jerid I was not sure whether janitor was going to visit our dorm, after all technically it was suppose to be a mens only dorm. I guess in a way you could say I felt sorry for Nikko – she didn't really have a dorm, or even really a house to go to. So you know what, I bit – don't regret it a single bit. I did however wonder if the janitor was going to find the drug cocktail. Believe me, I know Nikko. She is not the type to take drugs, just willy nilly. I need to do something to clear her name if she went, or take the time with her. But anyway I didn’t want to think about that at the moment. I had a hard time not snickering, because the room smelled of old tennis sneakers. I never was good at promises. But I do need to get some detergent.</p>

<p>“This is fun, way better than that stinky old dorm room.” I heard Avon say. I was on the other end of the isle, and Avon was browsing to check out some of the stuff on the shelf. Then walked he over to me. “Any luck finding anything?”</p>

<p>“No, we need to buy it online.” I said.</p>

<p>“What are we buying again?”</p>

<p>“You’ll see when I receive it.”</p>

<p>So we arrived back at the dorm room, and then formed a plan of action.</p>

<p>“So when are we going to get what your looking for?” Avon said.</p>

<p>“Probably in about a week.” I said.</p>

<p>So we waited for about a week, to get their our code box. Then when we received it, it came in a brown box, ... packaged discretely. So we tore apart the brown box, and looked inside to make sure we got our item. “Hey Avon, you want to help me build this?”</p>

<p>“Ah, do I have to?” Avon said.</p>

<p>“Fine whatever, I will do it.”</p>

<p>“Chill brother, I will help you out.” —</p>

<p>3 — Nikko The Finger Flick — So I was watching two mates – actually technically it was only Jerid was was my mate – but whatever. They put together the contraption, and then they took a short break to admire their work. And the device was like a lumbering shadow, the chair with the gas mask looked ominously to us. I thought it reminded me of my glaring mother – though not directly – though she did act like an electric chair sometimes. Then another one of Jerid’s friends opened the door.</p>

<p>I sure hope that’s not Horace, I thought.</p>

<p>“Hey It’s me, can I check out what you guys are up to?” the voice that sounded like him said. He waited outside the door, then the door slowly opened after Jerid unlocked it. And he was illuminated by the glow of the hallway L.E.D light rows. “I overheard your conversation, and became interested. ... Hey Nikko, how’s it going?”</p>

<p>“I was not going to involve you in this,” I heard Jerid say to him, while he was still outside of the door. But Horace was pushy, and let himself inside. “you alway’s mess shit up. ... What’s the password?”</p>

<p>“Shit sickle.” Horace said.</p>

<p>“Correct!” Jerid said.</p>

<p>“Come on Jerid, just let him in.”</p>

<p>“So what are you guys up to?” I heard Horace say.</p>

<p>“Me and Avon, just got down building.” I heard Avon say.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute Jay-Rod, you never told me what I helped in.” I heard Avon say.</p>

<p>“Why did not you ask before?” I heard Jerid say.</p>

<p>“On with it!” Horace said.</p>

<p>“Anyway, I was looking to confirm this rumor I heard about online. There was once this guy, that leaked this alter-net.” I heard Jerid say. He then slowly walked over to the chair, hovering his hands over his new baby meditation chair. “Supposedly, you could connect directly to your dreams.”</p>

<p>“Do you ever know what happened to the guy?” I heard Avon say.</p>

<p>“Well I’m not one for telling ghost stories.” I heard Jerid say.</p>

<p>“Oh come in, on with it or I want to go in now.” I heard Horace say.</p>

<p>“Well they say that his spirit haunts, the matrix.” Jerid said. He was trying to restrain laughter. “Just kidding about the last part but–”</p>

<p>“Move it! Move it! I’m going in.” Horace said abruptly. Then I saw Jerid tossed to the water bed. And thought even if there was not really his spirit there, it’s just like Horace to be reckless. But man seeing Jerid get owned was satisfying. It was within this innocent act of adventurism, that was found out rather accidently, that something did haunt the dream world. But it was not the spirit of the hacker. It was the spirit, of something else. It was something that was not quite human.</p>

<p>I Horace sit in the meditation chair, and then placed the gas mask over his face. His consciousness fizzled out like a frayed electrical wire.</p>

<p>Or at least that’s was his buzz indicated.</p>

<p>“What did you do to Horace!” I said to Jerid.</p>

<p>“Yea, what we do man. What kind of monster we create?” I heard Avon say.</p>

<p>“Relax, he’s just sleeping. ... Sort of.” —</p>

<p>4 — Jerid It was the next week, that we gathered the additional supplies we needed to come in after our friend.</p>

<p>For many days I wondered if people would think our friend had dropped out. And perhaps hoped it would be believable enough, as me and the other two hardly saw him studying in any of the classes that we shared together. He was not mean, I hoped he didn’t think this was some vengeful prank. He was just in his own world, thats all. But then Nikko probably wonders about me. But he – on the other hand – was another sort of day dreamer, one that would not awaken unless someone pulled him.</p>

<p>I pushed the memory out of my head.</p>

<p>“Avon, can you help me with this again?” I said.</p>

<p>“Sure, but we might need Nikko’s help too.” Avon said.</p>

<p>“Can’t you see I’m trying to focus on grades?” Nikko said.</p>

<p>“What kind of friend are you Nikko? Don’t you care about Horace?” Jerid said. Then I face palmed. “Choose your grades, or you friends. I’m sleeping in.”</p>

<p>They put the kits together, for all three chairs. —</p>

<p>5 — Horace “If you could have anything you wanted Horace,” the voice said to me. It was slightly more audible whisper than the waves within the darkness. But it was barely perceptible beyond a whisper. It pulsated the meshwork of the night. “what would you want?”</p>

<p>“I want ...” I said. Then tried to remember. It was always Horace that would try to wake me up from my dream. I never really liked being woken up you know? —</p>

<p>6 — Jerid We all placed the gas masks over our faces, and then I knew for sure my own vision faded to black — and then we were falling into a wormhole, changing in switching colors – it was translucent, floating through space. Then we warped into the meshwork, and the vision of it changed between the desires of the dreamer.</p>

<p>There was a flower Garden.</p>

<p>There was a diner.</p>

<p>There was a singing choir. —</p>

<p>7 — Nikko So I was walked through a church, and looked at the choir. They were singing hymns from my church. And then I finally remembered what it was. I just barely missed the opportunity to be in the band. It was thar god damned doctor’s visit, I had lost my voice. I could not longer sing. It was tossed away, like sand on the sea. There was a white cloud, covered in divine radiance. I saw it float down from the window of the room that was a manifestation. And illusion from the dream.</p>

<p>It seemed to have sense my mood.</p>

<p>But there was something, that made me ill about it, and it arrived through the window, of stained glass.</p>

<p>“If you could have anything you wanted, what would it be?” I heard the voice say. It sounded like my mother. Voice was of no particular shape or form, and was becoming louder from the whisper. It like that of an angel, a non nightmare. Heaven, shining lights. “I can give you the chance to sing again, to have a voice of your own.”</p>

<p>And then I stared at the choir, longingly. There is this feeling of jealousy when you see someone who could sing better than you. I heard them sing the song of peace. A piano melody, but it felt like the tunes of darkness. But there was another voice in my, I finally found – it wanted to be something better. But it died down like a funeral procession, the sound of trumpet’s blowing, Soldiers marching.</p>

<p>“I still barely have that voice,” I said longingly. Then stared into the stained window-glass. “I lost much of it after the illness.”</p>

<p>“I can undo this illness.” —</p>

<p>8 — Avon White I saw over the clear blue sky was like a form of heaven, that was not really there. She, or rather it, came down from the sky. And then the it rained softly in the garden, of which I wept.</p>

<p>“If you could have anything you wanted, what would you want it to be?” the voice said, softened into the voice of my mother in whispering softness. It like that of an angel, that was not really there.</p>

<p>I removed my hands, they fell. from his face. My tears tingling as they were wiped from the rain.</p>

<p>It was in this very long dream, that I visited my mother in the flower Garden were I once grew up. I was helping her carry the dirt to plant the varying species she needed to grow. I helped her dig the dirt, and split the labor of water to help the seeds.</p>

<p>“Mother, is this how you want it?” I was a kid at the time, you see.</p>

<p>“Yes, this is perfect.”</p>

<p>“Is that what you want?” the voice said. It was closer to the auditory level from the choir‘s church. A worship hall that I saw in the distant grassland. Like an eternity that would never end. And I heard Nikko’s voice singing in the distance. It wiped my tears away. “I can give you this, if you become a part of me. And help me improve.” —</p>

<p>9 — Jerid I sitting in a diner with my old flame. The date had that odd silence you would get, when you knew she was about to drop the bomb. A distant sound of music, playing. But it was not Nikko’s singing. It was the sound that was inside Jerid’s head. The sound was not quite silence. “Look, can we get back together again?” he said.</p>

<p>“I really don’t know what I saw in you.” the woman said. She said it quietly. like that of a whisper. But the answer did not feel genuine. It felt like a reenactment, organized by a two star play write. “But I will be happy to take your flowers.”</p>

<p>But she disappeared into smoke, and then the white light that I saw at the moment warped in through the window of the diner. “I can give you another chance, if you give in and become a part of my consciousness.”</p>

<p>“No, I won’t do it. I can move on. I have Nikko.” I said. And then I saw the white cloud for what it was. It was a very dark cloud, covered in powdered sugar. A toxic form of window-spray, covering the darkness. “I won’t let you have that power over me.”</p>

<p>And then, the dream-space became the meshwork.</p>

<p>“Come on guys, don’t be fooled.” I said to my friends. I had no idea where they were, but needed to find them. Right now. I need to find Horace, before the consciousness, overcame him. If there was anything in him, that was still left. But that fire, that thing called hope. Was uncovered, like the darkness.</p>

<p>“Something is trying to trick us.” I said.</p>

<p>“Jerid, I want to stay in the Garden.” Avon said.</p>

<p>Nikko continued singing, the song of the Choir.</p>

<p>I then decided, that I would go it on my own. For a moment I wondered where Horace was. But I was to preoccupied of not letting myself be overcome, by his own core desires. There was something driving but. But I did not know what. All I knew, was I wanted to rip a whole in this beings cosmic butt.</p>

<p>I ran, until I could run no further.</p>

<p>Jerid — I heard the voice say, “I ... am the voice ... I am the consciousness. I will punish you. ... You should not have come here.”</p>

<p>“Please, I was barely a shell when I first came to campus.” I said it. Whatever – it – was,</p>

<p>It warped closer to me, and attempted to absorb my consciousness. But instead, I attempted to give the entity a swift kick to the nuts.</p>

<p>But it – which had then taken the form of Horace – warped behind him, and elbowed me in the back. —</p>

<p>I woke up, on the floor. “Nikko! Avon! ... Horace!”</p>

<p>And then I heard knocking.</p>

<p>“Jerid, can you answer a few questions?” the voice on the other end of the door said. And I smelled the stench of cigar smoke, setting my lungs on fire. I was a tired wooden doll, barely surviving ... a brain-cataclysm. —</p>

<p>10 — Nikko There was something in my, that still felt wrong singing. It didn’t not feel natural form me. Song of the music, began to play slower, and became another sort of funeral procession. A funeral of my own personal free will. It felt that lover’s sing, that feeling only lover’s have – that call’s when one of their friends in his danger. Something like another chance at paradise.</p>

<p>So I stopped singing suddenly, and walked out of the Church.</p>

<p>And then ran through the indigo meshwork, browsing through the network of my desperate attempt to dream true dreams. Of another life. I swimming, through the ocean-sea of the dream-simulation. I had halted her my own person dream briefly to reflect. The simulation from the drugs used from the meditation chair.</p>

<p>It was the devil’s chair.</p>

<p>And then that white cloud warped in front of me.</p>

<p>It felt like an amalgamation of death. The imposter of dreams, the manifestation of war itself. Of nightmares, and bad breath. The breath of the choir boys, the singing angels from the otherworld. The realm of dreams, was its own sort of after life. An afterlife of eternal purgatory. Of heaven fading into darkness ...</p>

<p>But my own light broke through it.</p>

<p>Darkness, fading into the light.</p>

<p>“Horace, what has happened to you?” I said to Horace.</p>

<p>“I am not Horace. I ... am ... god itself.” the voice said. The voice that was a paradox of a silent screech. A screech, because it cut through her hyper sensory perception. Silent because know one could actually hear’s in dreams.</p>

<p>She felt at that moment, that Horace was gone.</p>

<p>“Do you know how it feels,” the husk of Horace said. Briefly Nikko wondered if Horace was coming back. One memory at a time, like scattered bits of data. “to be able to do anything in dreams.”</p>

<p>Aire’s data-interrupts Horace.</p>

<p>Nikko ran, until Horace faded into the darkness. —</p>

<p>Then I warped into the garden, where Avon was. “Nikko, don’t look back. Don’t worry about me, check on Jerid. I will hold off Horace.”</p>

<p>“That’s not Horace.”</p>

<p>I saw Avon take his shovel, and warped into the meshwork.</p>

<p>Into the darkness of the indigo ocean-sea ... —</p>

<p>I wondered for a moment, what if one died in the dream.</p>

<p>Then warped, and floated into Jerid’s dream-world. But there was nothing, because he was not asleep. But I sensed – somehow – that feeling of pain, from her connection to him. The perception was pins and needles into my throat.</p>

<p>I felt what he felt, and what he felt was confinement.</p>

<p>It was like a prison. But I did not recognize the location. A interrogation room perhaps, I did not know. But it was like snow, made out of acid rain. It charred the meshwork as much as did my dream-skin – I began to dissolve.</p>

<p>And with my right hand, the hand used to do to my homework – the hand that was going to be used to, toss the pillow at Jerid. —</p>

<p>11 — Jerid I saw the image of Nikko’s tender touch in Jerid’s eyes.</p>

<p>“When I logged into the blue membrane, I at first felt numb. And then I was pulsating. I don’t remember anything else.” Jerid said. I was staring, into the glare of the dream-scanner. And then I saw in greater detail, Nikko reaching out her right hand to me. My hand was touching onto hers. But I saw her became like a lake. A puddle of her original self. “Wait a minute, I know where my friends are now. Nikko had told me.”</p>

<p>“Your friends? Can you lead us to them?” the interrogator said.</p>

<p>“Yes, but don’t hurt them. Please. Hurt me instead.” I said.</p>

<p>“We have no plans of hurting anybody.” —</p>

<p>12 — Nikko So I was on the emergency room table. And felt a presence in the room, but could not identify it. I briefly wondered, if Horace was in another emergency room table for recuperative therapy somewhere. Because I did not feel his presence. I hoped if he was somewhere, that he was back to normal. Then I felt the voice, coming closer. Similar to that of Horace, but not quite.</p>

<p>It was barely perceptible, beyond a whisper.</p>

<p>A silence, that was not quite silence.</p>

<h2 id="shewasthewolfandIwasthesheep">She Was The Wolf, And I Was The Sheep</h2>

<p>Richard stared at the teacher, an inhuman mass of electronic pixels.</p>

<p>He reclined back into my seat, dreaming good dreams, of completing his home project when he got home. It was a robotic dog, he had been working over the past week. He could not afford a real pet at the time. The machine printed letters across the screen, and took role call. It came around to him, and his mind was a little dim, so a female student woke him up. He was a fuck up, who stayed under.</p>

<p>“Wake up, you don’t want to miss the anthem.” She said, with a smile fake enough to break glass.</p>

<p>He was, unresponsive, and was jolted out of his seat, by a sudden beep. It beeped out of control.</p>

<p>Disoriented and shaken up, and he stared at the screen. The monitor was playing a music video,of the new national anthem.</p>

<p>After the other students got back into their seats, Math class began its session. The electronic teacher printed out math worksheets. He stared into space, a wonderful place, while working on...boring pre algebra.</p>

<p>He drifted off into a daydream, and imagined himself with his new pet, once completed, when Juline was gone for work.</p>

<p>End of class, a ringing bell, the students rushed out of the classroom. He walked out of the door, but his arm was grabbed by his childhood friend.</p>

<p>“Hey wait.” She said.</p>

<p>“Brit, I’m busy. I need to get to class.” He said.</p>

<p>A sweet girl, a (mostly) innocent girl, but she was dumb. Richard had to keep an eye on her at lunch, to keep others from stealing her food. But eventually he realized, she could not be helped So he broke up with her.</p>

<p>“You never talk to me.” She said. Richard, a nerd boy, brushed her off with a cold shoulder, and rushed to class.</p>

<p>“Hey! Wait up!” Brittney said.</p>

<p>Her echo going in one ear, and out the other, was muffled by other students talking in the hall. He arrived to class four minutes, before the bell.</p>

<p>Richard was already seated, when she arrived to class. The monitor printed off letters</p>

<p>onto the screen:</p>

<p>“Tardy two.” The social studies monitor said. There was no use making excuses to pixel-ed glass.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry Britt.” Richard said. “The computers that printed off paddling permission slips are not in commission.”</p>

<p>“Sometimes I’d rather take the paddling, takes less time.” She said.</p>

<p>“Believe me, you don’t. Unless you don’t mind not sitting a day.” He said.</p>

<p>Richard was riding a school Bus, which was silver and sleek, at a comfortable speed in a lulling motion that puts you to sleep. It had a leather seated interior, with bright windows shining. He was sitting in his seat listening to rock music, while reading Hamlet.</p>

<p>Hamlet, a play written by Shakespeare, it was a trite mess that lulled him to sleep. He almost nodded off and began to do so. It was a dusty book that was wrinkled, which caused him to choke and cough. An old book written by an author before the invention of prose.</p>

<p>A boy sitting beside Richard, who wore big thick black glasses, had a fairly new book about ghosts. He had long trimmed platinum blond hair, and blue eyes Richard could stared deeply into. A young boy from a high grade tried to bully his friend, but Richard got up and smacked him in the balls with his left shoe.</p>

<p>“Come on comrade, that’s not how you treat brothers.” Richard said. He could see the bus driver staring through the rear view mirror.</p>

<p>“What’s going on back there.” The driver asked. He had a stern look that could stare into your soul.</p>

<p>The mixed words between both students jumbling into a jargon mess confused the driver. So he hovered above the city sidewalk, and pushed both of them out of the bus. Richard tried to get a word in, but he closed the door.</p>

<p>The bus flew into the sky once more.</p>

<p>Richard had to walk home, and he worried that he would not be home in time for curfew. And then he would earn another lecture from mom. He arrived at the door of his apartment flat, and pressed the code to open the door.</p>

<p>He slammed the backpack on the table, and then walked into the kitchen to grab some mushroom soup. He then tossed it into the microwave, and then sat at the table to do his homework he did not finish in class.</p>

<p>His mind drifted as the wrote down pre algebraic notation.</p>

<p>His cell phone, and he opened it to see who was calling. Brittney was the one on the other end.</p>

<p>“I thought I told you to not call me anymore?” Richard said.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, I just wanted to let you know, I decided to see if I could bribe a teacher to see if I can get swats instead of a detention on detention day.”</p>

<p>“Pffft, and how did that go?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know yet, I haven’t gotten an answer.”</p>

<p>“And this is what you wanted to call me about?”</p>

<p>“Uh yes?”</p>

<p>“Don’t call me again.” Richard pressed the button to hang up his phone.</p>

<p>Richard placed his cell phone back into his pocket, and then received another phone call. “God damn it Brit.”</p>

<p>He picked up his phone, getting ready to yell. But it was a sweet voice he recognized that was not Brittney. It was his mother.</p>

<p>“Hey Richard, I’m not going to be home till late tonight.”</p>

<p>“Oh ok.”</p>

<p>“I have a thing I need to work on with a patient.” Juline said. She worked as a nurse for a local private hospital. “I’ll see you at nine. Unless you decided to stay at a friends house without me knowing.”</p>

<p>“I’m home mom.” Richard said, resisting a chuckle.</p>

<p>“Take care sweety.”</p>

<p>“Bye mom.” Richard said, a hung up the phone. Richard finished up his soup and his homework, and headed to his room to watch the hologram television. He turned it on, but nothing by junk was on television.</p>

<p>His thoughts turned off the television.</p>

<p>Richard pulled out his seat of his wooden desk, which was not really wood but rather an industrial plastic wood purchased cheap by his mother. He took out his tool set and what was the beginning of his robot dog.</p>

<p>Richard tinkered with his toy.</p>

<p>Juline did not come home that night, which caused Richard to worry a little bit. Richard took out his cell phone to call her, but there was no answer. Richard had a sinking feeling in his gut that something happened.</p>

<p>He put up his toy and went to bed.</p>

<p>The next morning at the bus station, he tried to push by the crowd and get on. But the driver said he was not allowed to fly that morning. Richard looked glum and irritated, and walked to school that morning, arriving three hours later than he would have otherwise if Juline could have drove him.</p>

<p>Richard was in third period late morning, when the intercom called him into the office. It was the same old thing, children going ooooh when someone was in trouble. He walked through the hall, and wondered if it was about what went on with the bully yesterday.</p>

<p>Instead it was something different. Richard was sitting at the desk in the office of the principle, another monitor with a monotone voice. Two officers were standing beside the screen, looking sternly.</p>

<p>“We saw the threat you made against the bully.”</p>

<p>“Now I can explain.”</p>

<p>“Don’t bother. Your going to boarding school for another reason.” The computer flickered in and out. “As you may have noticed, you mom did not return to your home last night.”</p>

<p>“How did...”</p>

<p>“We have ways of spying on you Richard.” The computer flickered. “We know all about you on a registry. Your mom died last night in a hospital robbery. Enjoy the rest of the day, then pack your bags.”</p>

<p>The rest if his day was quiet.</p>

<p>Richard rode in a prison van along with the bully from school, with darkly lit lights other than the windows that passed by the city. He was going to a private school in Hudson, NY. This was the first time he would be going to a different school.</p>

<p>He had no idea whether he would make new friends, or what would happen. But there was one thing certain. It would not be anything like he has ever known. No more family, no more parents who he knew loved him.</p>

<p>Richard and the bully went through an admissions officer to get into the school, and they packed up their stuff in their dormitories to stay for the school year.</p>

<p>For first time in his life, Richard was scared. He was scared this his father would try to kill him, or worse take him back to his boarding school. There he would be placed back in solitary confinement until he turned eighteen.</p>

<p>Along the ledge of the road, he could see rows and rows of roads in the city highway, and at the bottom, a large dead tree with its branches broken off. They were sharp enough to puncture your skin.</p>

<p>Like someone pushing him off the ledge, his foot slipped and he clang to the edge of the road. His father tried to rescue him, but instead his hand was to weak from running to hold on any longer. The boy slipped.</p>

<p>A long ways down Richard came falling down.</p>

<p>It was like falling into a black hole of death, and at the bottom, a spiky pit. In a sudden stop, Richard blacked out from a sudden puncture of pain. In his remaining waking moment, he was bleeding.</p>

<p>He was dying.</p>

<p>Good fathers don’t let their kids die, and Edward wanted to shoot himself, but he was prevented from doing so by other S.W.A.T police.</p>

<p>Power drills with blindingly shiny metal are spinning many times per second, a loud noise whining with a boring-tool, which was going into the boys flesh, the melding between metal and meat on the amputee, who is screaming loudly with its puncture motion.</p>

<p>“Ah Ahhhh!” Richard screamed. The pain was intolerable. “Arrrgggh!”</p>

<p>He became man and machine, a partial boy made whole again standing up from the surgery table. he had major pain walking. He was a hunk of metal and flesh. Lonely hallways with lights buzzing in a rundown hospital. There was a human odor of a highly pungent smell of death. It reeked up from its tomb of pillows and used scalp-els, with the imprint of lost souls left behind that stinks.</p>

<p>A muted colored sky raining above endless rows of roads, cars are flying at lightning speed among neon lights. Malcolm held Richard up by his back, as he almost stumbled. Like a good friend, he would make him return the favor. A cool breeze blowing in the sky, a smell of dumpsters and dead rats.</p>

<p>Dead Rats, a health hazard, inedible and diseased, a symbol of starvation, and.death. it was a sickening sight, and he was hungry, cold, and wet. He avoided the dead litter on the ground to keep from being infected. They were rotting, ravaging, and unclean. The Grim Reaper took what it wanted, an insignificant speck of dust.</p>

<p>Of the time of his first accidental visit here, he could hardly breath. Like someone with a brain injury, his speech was mumbled. Malcolm paused to listen to him, but could not understand a word he was saying.</p>

<p>— How did things come to this?</p>

<p>All I could remember up to that point was being on a ledge, and the moment of an abrupt fall. It’s not the fall that gets you, but rather the sudden stop. I went pop onto the concrete, and at that moment I felt complete. My vision at that time began to completely fade, and everything as I hoped would soon come to an end.</p>

<p>This is my song of lost youth.</p>

<p>For a moment my vision came back, and felt more pain than I ever had in my life before. The sound of buzzing and wining metal was absolutely obnoxious, it felt like a moment in hell. An eternal darkness, a low toned bell. And then staring into a clinical stare, my vision was eventually graced to the light of buzzing ceiling light. “We look who decided to wake up today.” An old man that looked about fifty, had a high hairline with long white hair. “Your little girlfriend will be happy to see, when your out of recovery.”</p>

<p>And then soon passed out as soon as the pain from my whole body was simply to much to bare. For many weeks I was somewhere in between the world of dreams, and the waking world. Demonic faces, many graces upon the flesh biting into me. Tearing into my flesh, and each moment I was reassured by the doctor of pain. I did not care much what his name was, I simply wanted the pain to be over. After the weeks went by where I felt ill, I was let go. And that’s how I came to live in what I would call purgatory home. —</p>

<p>— It was a lonely existence, and the first night I woke up upon the couch. The pain was only made more tolerable by the fact that I was longer into the period of pain. I had a craving for the powder, wanted to swallow that chowder. And consume whatever it was that was able to make the pain from the cuts and then growing of flesh. But there was no sway to get Bianca. At least at the moment. “You need to find yourself a job, like everyone else. ... I can ask Malcolm, to see if he can set you up.”</p>

<p>Maybe things will get better, I thought.</p>

<p>But it would become much worse.</p>

<p>It soon became apparent to Bianca that it was simply to difficult for me to move at all. Even if I wanted to find employment, if not to find another way to kill myself, then by finding some drug to completely kill my perception of mental anguish. So the meeting was set up like this: Malcolm sat on the chair facing in my direction. “So what are you willing to do to earn a little bit of extra money to help pay the rent?” Malcolm said. Bianca, who had already been on thin ice with him by now, simply glowered at him. “What? He’s gotta know the truth at some point.” But eventually he was guilt-ed into changing his tune. “I can set you up with clean up duty on the last day of your recover. As soon as your ready to go, I’ll show you what you will need to do.”</p>

<p>It was another week later, at that point I had just gotten done with healing and getting used to be new robotic arm. Because I was still not yet used to its motion, it continuously made the herky jerky motion while I tried to use the broom. But let me tell you, trying to control a foreign body your body is just as soon to reject with your brain wave – well it’s lot easier to try to chew on sandpaper. Every single time it was struggle not to ram the stick into the wall. “God damn it, not that shit again.” But eventually I was able to get the hang of it. Oh this is only the beginning of it my friends. So eventually I was able to earn enough money to pretty much otherwise get a free ride. —</p>

<p>— After I had finally gotten used to using my robotic arm, me and Bianca started to get a little bit closer after she had finalized her break up with Malcolm. But we were still a little bit rough around the edges. I remembered one night in particular, that would ultimately spell the end of of my life as I knew it then, and lead up to the life I now know it as. It was on that night when I wanted to buy myself a new bottle of immune-suppressant pills. Bianca was on her cell-phone, possibly talking to her then ex boyfriend Malcolm who was away at work. He worked the graveyard shift always, set their relationship adrift. As she yammer-ed on the cell-phone, I tried to concentrate plugging into my forehead, after taking out my deck. My pink-screen came up, then I waved my fingers across the screen to get onto the network. “I want these, ... but they are to much.” Then pushed the window away, de-plugged from my forehead. One could hear the buzzing down of the system. At that particular moment, I could here what sounded like her speech at the table in the kitchen.</p>

<p>“Are you talking to me Richey?” said Bianca, my now ex. I was pretty sure that she was sitting at the table. Her action of hanging up was so quite that I could not even hear the beep. “I did not know you had a phone.” If she was watching me as often as she said she would, would she not know I did not have one?</p>

<p>“I don’t, I was –” Her tendency to interrupt was made easier, by my physical state. I felt like the couch. At that moment, which came sooner than I wanted, I felt a narrowing of my own inner thoughts. For the pain from my robotic arm, was to much to bare. I no longer wanted to think about her or anything else.</p>

<p>“Don’t talk to yourself Richey.” she jeer-ed. Up until that point she had not chosen to talk to be very much, so why in the hell she wanted to talk to be right then I had no clue. At that moment I would have rather have been spanked by her shoe, as it would have broken the silence that was between me and her over the particular week that would begin the story that I’m about to recall to you.</p>

<p>Walking into the lonely quite kitchen, where the only other person was me and Bianca, and the room was lit merely by the glow of the flickering L.E.D light, I walked over to the fridge in order to get a glass of water. I had to have something to quench my thirst, to distract from the true physical pain. “So Bianca, you’ve just now decided to talk to me? It’s been so quiet here, and with your boyfriend–” I began to say.</p>

<p>“That’s Ex to you.” Bianca said.</p>

<p>“Fine then fruit pie, Ex – working the night shift, who is going to talk to me?” Though in retrospect now I feel a little bit funny about saying that, whether that would be the case if she not complained I’m not sure.</p>

<p>“I do want to talk about your pill –”</p>

<p>“But I need them for the pain fruit pie.”</p>

<p>“Would you stop call me fruit pie.” It was not the name fruit pie, that made her want me to die though that did not help her thinking of me like a bug and make me want to yelp by squashing me.</p>

<p>“Yes, but are you –” I said.</p>

<p>“I just don’t feel like talking this week.” Bianca just stared at me, with her gaze that was a mixture of loneliness and absolute complete disdain. Made me feel so profane, and wonder why it was she chose to call for an alarm, all those years ago. I felt like my soul was lost, in the fall.</p>

<p>“Just break the silence every once in a while, that’s all I’m asking for OK.” And then I walked back to my couch, and then said goodnight on my brain-jack deck, and played the slow melody of nature music: the sounds of deserts blowing, the sound of ocean torrents, and the call of the wind.</p>

<p>Bianca still tried to talk to me while she was in the kitchen. I tried to tune her out, but part of me still wanted to listen to her speech. “Malcolm is not going to be home till late, again. I tried telling him to leave that business, but he simply will not listen. ... I guess it’s his fault if he gets shot.”</p>

<p>I thought, lady I hope you rot. I had never seen her like that before, wondered if there was something she remembered. Something that she was not telling me. It always seemed like she was still more attached to him than me, even though she was – apparently – still dating me at that moment. So I bursted open the bedroom door, causing my robotic arm to jerk and twitch. Man that pain hurt like a bitch, still feel that to this day. Our bedroom we had together, that was there to share. A for many a week, there was no other care in the world. Everything seemed to fade away, at the sound of a goodnight kiss, and dimmed lamplight. There was no other gadgets, no consoles for people our age, no toys other little children got to play with. The song of lost youth. Only that rotted floor that I still wonder why one of us had not fallen through it.</p>

<p>When our parents died, there was nothing left for us. Nothing we had inherited. Nothing but the stained Earth. Walking up to the window, I saw the sky. A sunlight that never went through the thick grey clouds. I could hear her clog steps, and she walked beside me at the window. “Hey I’m sorry about that, I have just been a little bit stressed out lately. So what are you looking at?”</p>

<p>I pointed to the sky.</p>

<p>“What do you think it’s like?”</p>

<p>“Like where?”</p>

<p>“In the city, up there.”</p>

<p>“Dream on OK.” Bianca said, hugging me tightly. Which once again caused my robotic arm to twitch. She eased off as soon as she noticed she was hurting me, about a whole minute later. “That was years ago, I still have no idea where you came from. But this is your home now Broggie.” Covering up her face, she crouched on the floor.</p>

<p>I just stared into the sky. —</p>

<p>— “Are you ready to order?” I heard the waitress say, as gradually as the vision from inside my dream began to fade way. I could distinctly remember various advertisements playing over in my brain over and over again.</p>

<p>“Yea I’ll take a coffee.” I was not sure whether she would understand what I was saying being drowsy.</p>

<p>I ordered, ate, then exited.</p>

<p>Then after going through the sliding glass doors, tried to remember what it was that made me want to remember what those ads specifically were. Were they ads from when I was plugged into my deck? I got the impression that only worked, when plugged into the network. Bianca was outside to greet me, in the thick green fog that covered the city. I saw her take a powder, choking and snorting on it after accidently taking a breath into it. Fumes were tossed in the direction of my face, and I did not appreciate it very much. “Remember boy, ... you need me. Or you will die ... cold during the night.” she said, in that near calmness that would give just about anybody chills. Although I knew she was right, I needed something for my mental fight. Bianca’s generosity was the only reason I was even alive at all. —</p>

<p>— The next morning I was disturbed by Bianca’s cell-phone, and woke up as if rising from a fall. “How was your sleep dear wanderer?” she asked rhetorically. I think at eighteen, I’m a little bit to old to be called a run-away. Besides she’s not my mother. I was not sure what felt more like a sledgehammer. Her grating voice, that can cat through anyone like a sword, or because of my aching robotic arm and my suppressant withdrawals. That pain medication that I had started, to ease my recovery. “So let’s talk money for a minute.” I said to my dear fruit pie.</p>

<p>“Do you wish to grab my only bullets?” she said to me.</p>

<p>“I only wish to know how much, you think is reasonable to give me to take the medication that I need.” She knew good and well I was unemployed, and I may have to do what Malcolm was doing at the time in order to help pitch in.</p>

<p>“That you can carry it around with you,” she said, in that slightly sless grating voice that was still grating. “To buy more of that powdery pill stuff.” Though I knew what she was getting at, if she wanted to talk about drugs – she needed to do something about her own addiction.</p>

<p>“Well I’m going out.” I stood up naked.</p>

<p>“Hey cover yourself up – with this blanket.”</p>

<p>It was my friend’s Malcolm and Bianca who were hanging out at the diner just down the road from our little sham shackle. I was of course being the little un-attentive asshole that I was to the conversation, taking my pills to subdue the herky jerky from my robotic arm. “At some point man,” Malcolm said to me. Then he snickered un-amusedly, “you need to buy your own.” And then he raised one of his eyebrows at the waitress, who placed his hamburger plate down on the table.</p>

<p>“I will have a soda, make it a large.” Bianca said, choking on a powder. Causing Malcolm to growl at her, because she spewed powder on his shirt. She puckered her lips mockingly at her Ex boyfriend who smiled with a grimace. “Our Broggie ran away from home yesterday.” And then pushed Malcolm away grabbing the soda from the waitresses hands. “Thanks a bunch, now buzz off will you. Me and Malcolm are having a moment.”</p>

<p>A moment, right. “I can sense the false motherhood.”</p>

<p>“You guys just can’t get along can you?” said Malcolm.</p>

<p>Outside the diner, Ellen and Slephner walked inside through the sliding glass doors. To the table right behind us, they sat. Us three tried not to pay any particular attention to these mother fuckers. And everything was at first all going according to the plan. We will simply just eat quietly, and then leave quietly.</p>

<p>Slephner eye-balled my family with his grill, with a fake smile. But – get this – Malcolm did not really seem to notice or care. I don’t really understand how anyone could get used to it, with that tension that was boiling under the surface. I tried to pretend like I was not noticing Ellen. I then switched to looking at my menu. “Hey Richard, hurry and order will you.” said Malcolm, as quietly as he could muster talking to me.</p>

<p>“Ellen let’s get a to go box.” said Slephner.</p>

<p>“Right.” said Ellen. —</p>

<p>— Inside the barbershop I was watching Ellen collect tickets from to conspicuous looking peers, I did not recognize from before. Did Slephner recruit new men? I had no idea – but there was something about them, that gave me bad vibes. The ones renting the place still had not payed rent for that month, evidenced by the light that was buzzing in and out in the overhead, and so I barely saw Ellen sitting in the bleachers.</p>

<p>At first I observed the dog fight through the dream-display, with my trodes plugged into the pink ocean-sea. I had a hard time not giggling – I couldn't help it you know, it looked like dogs playing to me. A special breed of pooch, one would purchases on the black market in these parts. Modeled after the pit-bull and the wolf. I get the vibes that it must have had its share of blood, even before they have gotten to the ring. I didn't know that of course – it was just that feeling you know.</p>

<p>It was at the moment, I started to feel a little bit of guilt.</p>

<p>Not only for how I treated Ellen, in the diner – but also for those dogs in the ring. It’s strange how you grow up one way, get used to that. Then it’s abruptly switch up on you like a speeding train. And as much as you try to get used to the new life – there is still something deep inside – that still get’s to you. That feeling of being another dog in the ring.</p>

<p>So to take those thoughts away, I tried to look at Ellen whenever I could. But I could not push my thoughts away from that dream – that dream I always wanted – a piece of electronic paradise. Not just a momentary paradise, that illusion of ocean-sea. Something like eternity. Something – that became very obvious was not here. I saw Slephner turn around to look at Ellen, while monitoring his Pit-wolf in the arena — Malcolm’s pooch was on the other side of the dream-display.</p>

<p>Slephner gave a thumbs up sign, like a confident rat. Nothing could take away his confidence. This pooch, that belong to my best friend – or was the closest to being one – was like a hemp rope chopped through by sharp teeth.</p>

<p>Ellen reluctantly gave one back to him, with a toothy grin. Normally I wouldn't dig it, but you know what, whatever right? She was still pretty enough you know. I tried to focus as much as I could, through to the game.</p>

<p>They pit-wolves pounced.</p>

<p>Then swiftly clawed first strike — The conspicuous peers that were not part of either of our groups, were sitting at a table as I un-plugged the trodes. It was the furthest place you could get from a normal audience seat. They stood at the back wall, waiting. Something about them scared me – it unnerved me even more than Slephner himself. But what was it?</p>

<p>I looked at the circular stage, into the multi-window-pane dream display. I heard one of them make a statement to his friend to the side as he looked onward.</p>

<p>“So you want to place a bet?” he said. Though I could barely hear him.</p>

<p>“Oh boss, isn’t that–” his friend said. I could barely here them as well. It felt like one of those whisper you would here, from something in the dark.</p>

<p>“Oh relax, were already," the guy who appeared to be the main guy said. Then I at a brief moments glance, saw him place the pipe in his mouth. I could barely him the rest of his statement. “breaking the law anyway doing this. Technically.”</p>

<p>“... O I bet a fifty.” the other said.</p>

<p>“Raise you double.” the leader-like man said.</p>

<p>“Triple.”</p>

<p>“Your on, lets watch the match.”</p>

<p>We knew, even if their own dog lost one of it's ears, a brew for a another ear could in theory be generated from its gene code – though it's not like we could have afforded it – we were broke, inside and out. It was my friend Malcolm, who felt more attached to his pit-wolf – since according to what he's told me – he has grown up with it.</p>

<p>“Your not going anywhere.” I heard the man near the back say. I knew it, I fucking knew it you know?</p>

<p>And then Slephner’s dog jumped at the two cops.</p>

<p>The remaining dogs, owned by me and Bianca misunderstood the gesture. Then all scale bloodbath. The pit-wolves started attacking everyone. One even tried to bite my prosthetics, but I swatted it. —</p>

<p>— It was only me and Ellen who survived.</p>

<p>I was abruptly thrown from my memory, hugged by Ellen, who had her face in my chest. She was shaking, and getting my shirt wet.</p>

<p>“Let’s go somewhere far away, start a new life.” Ellen said.</p>

<p>I thought the dogs cry out, we pout with agony.</p>

<p>Like lonely sheep torn apart by wild dogs.</p>

<p>Me and Ellen, were on the run, hiding out in another sector of the metropolis. Beneath the floating city.</p>

<p>“So where are we going to go?” she said to me.</p>

<p>“Someplace, somewhere. Not here. Anywhere.” I said to her.</p>

<p>“How are your limbs?”</p>

<p>“Good enough, why?”</p>

<p>“I just wondered,” she said to me, I could feel her behind me. I was not sure what she was going to do me. The previous incident the night before has made me a little bit ancy. “I know you were walking funny.”</p>

<p>“I will be fine, thanks.”</p>

<p>Even if I did not trust Ellen, I still wished we had met Ellen in any other circumstance, other than this.</p>

<p>It was your atypical date, but something.</p>

<p>... She was the wolf, and I was the sheep. –</p>

<h2 id="erasedfaces">Erased Faces</h2>

<p>The subway station wined with the sound of wheels grinding - a young man took a picture of the moving train with his cell phone, and then quickly hid it in his black overcoat.</p>

<p>Stevie walked up the escalator, carefully avoiding attention from the security guard that was patrolling the train station. As he rode the escalator, he catches a glance a security camera that snaps a pictures of him.</p>

<p>“Shit!” He said.</p>

<p>He got up to the stairs that reached up to the sea level, the main road.</p>

<p>However he was caught off guard by them before he reached the stairs. “What do you think your doing? This is a high security area. Show your badge and security number.” The guard tipped his hat to protect from the sunlight. “What are you waiting for, show me.”</p>

<p>Stevie flashed his fake I.D, one he made for the occasion he kept in his wallet.</p>

<p>The moment the cops took the Identification to look at it, he made another break for it. Stevie quickly walked up the stairs.</p>

<p>Stevie arrived at his apartment complex. It was a rundown brick apartment, with rats crawling all over the pavement behind the dumpsters. It was a wretched hive. He went to knock on the door, then took out his pictures.</p>

<p>“What’s you got there?” Deano said.</p>

<p>“I took a picture of the subway train.” Stevie said.</p>

<p>“And what did you find?”</p>

<p>“You were right, that station,” Stevie wiped the sweat from his brow. “really is filled with government agents.”</p>

<p>Deano walked over to Stevie, and looked over his shoulder to see what the picture looked like.</p>

<p>“Hey bro, they’re a little blurry,” Deano continued snorting up coke. “This time you need to take Yossaphat with you. I think you rushed.”</p>

<p>“But boss!”</p>

<p>“No butts, you need someone to protect you," Deano was getting ready to slap him across the face. “you ran off quickly you measly coward!”</p>

<p>Stevie went to visit Yossaphat in the basement, who continued to work on his sawn off shotgun in the basement, while Deano hung out on the couch to snort up coke.</p>

<p>“Hey, lets go gets some pictures.”</p>

<p>“Not now, I gotta finish this weapon.”</p>

<p>“Yossaphat Jossadine Smith!”\</p>

<p>“OK! OK, I’ll complete the gun later.” Yossaphat said. “But first..."</p>

<p>Some cops were knocking at their door. In a flash, the group went through the opposite door of the other side.</p>

<p>They took their flat screen laptop, and their clothes with them, and tried to find an alternate route to evade capture.</p>

<p>The sliding doors opened, letting the trio inside who are dressed like maintenance plumbers for the subway car.</p>

<p>How many people were in the train? The group had no idea, however they had to cling to the side of the train in order to avoid the massive body heat of the car.</p>

<p>“Hey guys,” Deano huddled the group together. “Let’s go find a seat to sit in. Somewhere in the back.”</p>

<p>They were a plumber dressed group sitting in their seats. A subway clerk is walking toward the trio, and intended to ask them a question. “Hey, it’s about time we got some cleaning crew here! Can you do us a favor and clean the toilets, it’s starting to stink in there.”</p>

<p>Deano did not want to blow their cover. He decided quickly, “Yea, lets do it boys.”</p>

<p>Stevie wondered if it was such a good idea, however he did not feel like complaining.</p>

<p>Steve, Deano, and Yossaphat were trying to clean the toilet in the subway cars restrooms. The restroom smelled of shit.</p>

<p>“God damn it Yossaphat,” Deano jerked away the plunger. “Here let me do it.”</p>

<p>“Hey, what the hell is taking so long cleaning the bathroom guys, we have a customer that needs to go.”</p>

<p>“Shit.”</p>

<p>They did their business, and then got off the train swiftly. “Why did you have to mess that up Yossaphat? Jossadine, is that what you want me to start calling you?”</p>

<p>“No boss!”</p>

<p>The city was covered with filth - the plumbers ran swiftly.</p>

<p>For the time being, they only safe place to go was to purchase a hotel room somewhere in the city. They had a friend of theirs who lived here. </p>

<p>The group are running through the sidewalk, until they reach a bar. The sun beat down in their bodies like a fucker. </p>

<p>“God its fucking hot out here.” Stevie said.</p>

<p>“Get over it, get moving.” Deano Said.</p>

<p>They kept their plumber cover going until they were able to reach the street club, where they bought some cool drinks to ease off the heat from the walk.</p>

<p>“We only have thirty minutes, before we need to be on the move again." Deano said.</p>

<p>Never being ones to completely listen to what he said took an extra minute to finish their drinks.</p>

<p>The boss had a major sissy fit. “Let’s go, now!" Deano said.</p>

<p>“Yes sir." Yossaphat said.</p>

<p>“Right! Right!" Stevie said.</p>

<p>Deano nudged them in the back of a Taxi with his shotgun in the back of the drivers head in order to keep them moving.</p>

<p>The driver at one point stopped his car.</p>

<p>“Hey, how much are you guys going to pay me for this?” The driver said.</p>

<p>“Keep moving, if you don’t want your head blown off!”</p>

<p>The driver in a panic had to make a decision. Will he restart his car or will not not start his yellow car?</p>

<p>“To late, fucker!” Deano said.</p>

<p>Deano pushed him out of the car, and drove his car off. The driver tried to catch back up with his car to retrieve it, however it was no use.</p>

<p>He paused on the sidewalk to call the cops.</p>

<p>"I'd like to report a burglary."</p>

<p>"Your client identity number please?"</p>

<p>“I’d like to report three plumbers.”</p>

<p>“Are you kidding?”</p>

<p>“That sounds stupid”</p>

<p>“Are you going to get my car!”</p>

<p>They are driving down the cities road.</p>

<p>“How long are we going to keep wearing this stupid outfit?” Stevie asked.</p>

<p>“As long as we need to before we reach a friends.” Deano said.</p>

<p>Deano pulled out his cell phone.</p>

<p>“Hey, can we stay for a night in your hotel room.” Deano said.</p>

<p>Since the technician did not want to piss them off, and figured they would only stay for the night he said, “Sure, what room you want?"</p>

<p>During the night, the technician called the cops.</p>

<p>“Yes I’d like to report some plumbers.”</p>

<p>“Name and identity number.”</p>

<p>“I need to go get my piece of paper to retrieve the information.”</p>

<p>Deano overhead the technician in the bedroom, because it was a hotel room right beside the technicians room.</p>

<p>“Hey guys we need to get up now!” Deano said.</p>

<p>“This is early!" Stevie said.</p>

<p>“You would be alarmed to, if you heard on the phone what I heard."</p>

<p>They quickly climbed down with blankets through the window.</p>

<p>The technician saw them climb down the window into the street below. So he was more urgent to get the piece of paper he wrote it down on.</p>

<p>“Hey, I can’t find my sheet!”</p>

<p>On the run they wear plumber outfits, with tool bags jingling in their jeans. They hustled, they ran swiftly. They were the erased faces.</p>
        
      <h2 id="agentyasuki">Agent Yasuki</h2>
      <p>A young Japanese woman with a hand gun, slowly opens a door into an apartment. Gun drawn, she uses a tool to check the innards of its walls: "So far, no bombs in the walls. Only cockroaches, which everyone has". She wears a pair of skin tight blue jeans, and man's long sleeve pink button up. She finds instead of it being a studio, there is a long hallway that goes to another section of the studio. She takes her camera to study around the wall and into the next studio, by controlling a drone that studies the current threat while presenting itself as a something no larger than a fly.</p>
      <p>The further it flew, the darker the studio got, until eventually the network went into a different floor and wall installment, where it had different server installations. The it stopped at a U crossing, where at the end of it was a staircase downward. Seeing as there were luckily people with guns with invisible shielding, she slowly walk into the studio clinging onto the wall. Once she reached the studio clinging to the outside wall, she activated her invisible shield.</p>
      <p>Here she walked slowly, because the floor was metal out of metal framing, unless the rest of the studio network. There was a British guy that walked around with his gun drawn. There was someone else, a fat woman who had shoulder length hair, accompanying his presence.</p>
      <p>The investigator in invisible shielding blew up her camera drone in the downstairs that direct their attention. Once the British guy left into the downstairs hallway, she activated another camera drone as a replacement. After funding out the real facility in which the two worked, she found this was part of a larger encampment of people of their ilk, that kept a stockpile of supplies. She blew up her second camera drone in the second hallway. The British guy walked up the stairs to tell her he has found a camera drone, but instead thinking it was someone else, she put a bullet in the head of the British room mate. Figuring out what she did, she put a bullet in her mouth.</p>
      <p>– That takes care of the guard problem, said the agent. She deactivated her invisible shield, took out a third and final camera drone. Then clung to the wall. Her drone was installed with its own micro-weaponry, a special air toxin that puts you to sleep in thirty seconds after breathing it in.</p>
      <p>One of the other fellow catacomb campers walked outside the hallway to see what the noise was up stairs. The agent used the camera drone as a lure to misdirect this person, then activated the poisonous gas.</p>
      <p>Quickly the agent goes through the downstairs walkway, careful to cling to the walls. She found that this was a much larger hallway connecting a network of abandoned office buildings; similarly to old medieval communes, they posted their agreement upon the entrance.</p>
      <p>With her shield still activated, she made a report: most of the guards are dead, but there was one still alive the police can take in for questioning. Carefully, she exited the back exit, so as to avoid disturbing the other residence, who were asleep at this hour. Then deactivated her invisible shield.</p>
      <p>– Dodged a bullet there.</p>
      <p>The police activated the invisible shielding, then apprehended the live suspect. They carefully made sure not to wake up the other residence, who will simply wake up to find the suspect has vanished.</p>
      <p>– We got a live one. Group running an illegal server farm.</p>
      <p>Later, on a plea bargain, the woman met the agent, who offered her her life in exchange for information about the rest of the server operators. – We can even make you an agent.</p>
      
      <h2 id="andysgames">JEINKA'S CAMPING TRIP WITH KILLER ROBOTS</h2>
<p>It was a hot summer afternoon when Jeinka and her friends were walking through the wood, that were overlooking at deep quary. She didn't remember how long it had been since she had went camping, except for one incident where she nearly slipped over the edge. Keillene was holding her backpack, that somehow managed not to hinder her walking pace. Jeinka was beginning to heave heavily from being out of breath, and firmly placed her clog onto the rock that was baked into the dirt. "Can you see it Keillne?" said Jeinka, who was trying as hard as she could not to show that she was so tired.</p>
<p>Keillene and her own friends, walked over and looked at the scenery below. It was the first time they had went camping out in the woods, as every point before then had been in ground specifically for making camp. "I wouldn't want to jump down there." Keillene said. She instructed her friends to keep up the pace, as they ran all the way to the camp ground. Jeika on the other was simply to slow to keep up. She was still hobbling on one of her legs that she had feel on from a jumping rope accident.</p>
<p>"Wait a minute, keep up!" said Jeinka.</p>
<p>It was at the camp ground that they were roasting hot dogs, like usual campers would. "You don't want the fire to burn your hells do you." said Keillene, who noticed that her friend was keeping her feet close to the fire. Jeinka did not seem to care much, who continued on it as she watch. Eventually on her on time she sat herself up in her seat, and then pressed her knees together, got out her back pack, and then got out one of her books that she was reading for her summer reading.</p>
<p>"Do you always read Jeinka?" said Keillene. The other were already way to tired, and were to preoccupied with eating their roasted hot dogs and some mores. "I don't know if I've ever seen you without a book." she continued, and then rubbed her eyes softly as if she herself were getting tired. Although if you would have asked her, she probably would not have admitted it. Jeinka closed the book, not because she would have listened to her friends, but more to cover up her sense of worry.</p>
<p>"Your right, it is getting late." said Jeinka.</p>
<p>"That doesn't answer my –" said Keillene.</p>
<p>"Go fuck yourself." said Jeinka.</p>
<p>The whole crew was already in their bunks, when when Jeinka was hearing talking outside. She wondered if it was the remaining bits of dream before she could be fully awake. So she rubbed her eyes to make she that she was completely awake. She looked through the crack through the door, her bestie and her other friend looked like they had cracks all over. And within these cracks looked like some sort of metallic texture. The cracks within the skin glowed an electronic yellow. "What, whats going on?" Jeinka said. Carefully so as to make sure that the others would not hear her.</p>
<p>She carefully went back to bed after abruptly closing her door, not caring much at the moment as to whether the others would be able to get inside. Jeinka wondered who her friends really were, wasn't sure whether she actually wanted to know. Wanted to instead keep herself under the covers, until morning came. ... But then the others came a walking, then silence. Then ... Bam! Knock, knock, knock. "Hey let us in, we really need to get some sleep tonight."</p>
<p>This caused her to jump in her bed, and shiver. "Who are you, what do you want?"</p>
<p>"Jeinka, it's just us. Your friends."</p>
<p>"No your not, your robots."</p>
<p>Silence, then cackling. "Hey guys, lets just sleep together in the other bunk." For a moment she wondered whether the others were actually her friends, or rather convincing robots. She opened the door in order to take the risk, and saw them opening the other door.</p>
<p>"Well, aren't you going to let us in?" said Keillene.</p>
<p>"UH, sure thing."</p>
<p>It was the next morning that they walked back home to their neighborhood. Keillene was trying carefully to walk to the pace of Jeinka, who refused to even look at her Bestie. "Why did you have to dump a water bucket on me?" said Jeinka.</p>
<p>"Oh relax, it was a joke." said. Keillene.</p>
<p>She ran over to her other friends who decided to race to the neighborhood. Jeinka tried her hardest to keep up the pace with her girlfriends, but it was no use.</p>
<p>Jeinka was out of breath.</p>
<p>"Wait, wait up!"</p>
<p>ANDY'S GAMES</p>
<p>In the distant desert, black thin triangles hovered and flew slowly in formation, maneuvering like a game of chess — a blinding flash of yellowish white light — the sky faded back into a pinkish red, and then all fell silent.</p>
<p>The air had seen it's better days years ago.</p>
<p>It had become dirtier, as the years went by, as the war continued onward. The city scape, a complex of many adobe building, was beginning to crack. Like it would collapse any moment, and the only time the place was ever cleaned was every other week.</p>
<p>Thus, it became a landfill of it's own making.</p>
<p>Andy picked out an old computer, a model from a month ago. The technology was progressing by the month, faster than the previous five years rules in olden times. Faster even than mores law.</p>
<p>Andy "The dreamer" wondered what good sixteen bits are loaded on the hard drive on the hunk of rusted metal and fiberglass he was digging up. It was here that he could find used games. Stores could no longer shelf used games or indie games. Old disk of indie games would be dumped here.</p>
<p>Jerid on the other side of the dump, walked over to him.</p>
<p>"So what did you find man?" Jerid said.</p>
<p>"I find this old model." Andy said.</p>
<p>His friend looked closely at the machine. It looked similar to an older computer he once owned, before his parents exchanged it for a new model.</p>
<p>"You want to keep it?"</p>
<p>"Let's install it at our hideout."</p>
<p>The hide out was a dimly lit, with buzzing lights. It was once an old work shack owned by an old man. However the geezer had not been around recently, and they assumed he must have died. People went missing around these parts. The two boys have renovated it as their own personal castle.</p>
<p>The two had set up their computer.</p>
<p>The computer was a small lab top, no bigger than a web book. However it was not like older models. The model could play the latest games, the most powerful ones with ... enhanced sixteen bit graphics.</p>
<p>This might sound like a joke, but for indie games there is an insistence on improving ones pixel art, instead of 3D graphics. But this was as much as a kid their age could afford.</p>
<p>"What would you think about having a 3D engine?" Andy said. He assumed that Jerid would know he was half joking. However Jerid look at him straight faced.</p>
<p>"I would love to, but I can't afford it." Jerid said.</p>
<p>"I'm kidding anyway. I'll see you at-"</p>
<p>"I wonder what computers will be dumped next month?"</p>
<p>Andy looked at him. He wondered why he mainly cared about games. For him, he wanted to do other things. Participate in real world games. Even if these games were dangerous.</p>
<p>"Have a good night dude."</p>
<p>"Night bro."</p>
<p>He want ahead and went to his room, before dinner. He then placed his bag on the bed. Because of the size of his computer, and the fact the he set it on mute, his mother would never here him turn it on.</p>
<p>Or if she asked he would just say, "Yea mom, I'm doing my homework on the computer tonight."</p>
<p>He wondered why his mother never asked.</p>
<p>He wondered if she even really cared.</p>
<p>And then he had a moments thought, If she were to die today what would be there to drive him to do anything? Andy shut down his small laptop, and reclined on the bed.</p>
<p>"Andy, it's time for dinner?" His mother said.</p>
<p>"Coming mom." Andy said.</p>
<p>The moon glowed brightly – the night-watch flew in the sky nightly. Mothers would tell their children, "You better watch out, general pork chop is going to get you in your sleep, if you don't behave and go to bed."</p>
<p>Of course his mother never told him this.</p>
<p>His mother never told him anything.</p>
<p>When she would talk, she would ask him about grades. However at this point she considered him enough of a failure, she wouldn't pursue it further. She would only pay attention to behavioral reports.</p>
<p>He fell into a dark blue worm hole, changing between colors — he warped into a collection of binary numbers, flowing in the net — and then he arrived at his favorite dream site. His dream vision played gopher ball.</p>
<p>These were his games.</p>
<p>Of course he hardly had a chance to play them, he enjoyed specific plat-former titles on the dream net. He thought it was funny that Jerid still wondered what the next months super laptop trashed would be like. He wanted to prove to Jerid, he could get an engine of his own. If only Jerid could sleep.</p>
<p>If only Andy could...</p>
<p>"Andy, It's time for school!" His mother said.</p>
<p>"OK, thanks mom." He said. He made himself slowly get up. And then his mother knocked on the door.</p>
<p>"Andy, aren't you going to get up?"</p>
<p>"Yes mom, sorry I'm up."</p>
<p>MOMENTS</p>
<p>Ailene had long since given up on worrying about whether her glass was half full or half empty. To her, she was stuck on the bottom of the glass half empty or not.</p>
<p>Working as a janitor in a busy office, Ailene sometimes overheard the rah rah attitude in the meetings. She, on the other hand, experienced brain paralysis as she cleaned the dingy bathrooms. She could put a shine on the cracked mirrors, but trying to cover up the moldy smell was like putting deodorant on after you ran a marathon.</p>
<p>Walking to and from work, Ailene wished she was deaf. The city was loud. Everyone always stared because she would hold her ears, and would never push the button to stop traffic. Someone else would have to push it. She wanted time to merely stop.</p>
<p>Poor diet and an early smoking habit made her look older than her fifteen years. She started each day with a bitter cup of cheap black coffee. This always reminded her of her early homelessness. Another trigger of painful memories was the daily roar of fighter jets overheard. How many years it been since the war began?</p>
<p>It was a memory that long burned in her brain. There was never a time she missed begging for scraps of old bread. Nobody would hire a twelve year old, but her mother did not want her. Nobody did, she didn't exist.</p>
<p>Her job was low-paying, but she was glad to have anything. Ailene remembered how for the longest time she hadn't been able to afford shoes. When she had visited an antique shop, where the owner sported a powdered wig, she had noticed he was tossing a pair of old wooden clogs in the trash. She stole them when she thought he wasn't looking, but he ended up seeing her do it. "I'm going to call the cops." he had said in a thick accent. Seeing the tears in Ailene's eyes, he had changed his mind.</p>
<p>Every day there were news reports of bomber raids, and then the next story was a new biological weapon many times worse than Aids. Raids of the toxins.</p>
<p>Ailene had recently saved up enough money to order a new pair of clogs from the shoemaker. As she was leaving his store with those, she saw a shoe less girl about the age she had been when she first met the antique shop owner. With a painful jolt, time seemed to stop. Ailene thought of the shop owner who had become her friend, but who had died during a bombing raid. She knew he would be pleased to see Ailene give the little girl the shoes that meant so much to her.</p>
<p>That night Ailene dreamed of a world where childhood was special again. She dreamed it, but didn't get to live it. Just as her face aged early, so had her heart. She died not by a bomb or a biological weapon, but by a worn out heart.</p>
<p>At Ailene's funeral, there were only two mourners: the mother who had deserted her, and the little girl who had received her shoes. The mother was crying, partially out of regret, but partially out of the reality of how common early childhood homelessness was.</p>
<p>"So what was she like?" asked the girl.</p>
<p>"I don't remember." said the mother.</p>
<p>The little girl placed the wooden clogs on Ailene's grave.</p>
<p>"Thank you." she said.</p>
<p>DR. GREGOR COLE</p>
<p>"I place a helmet on your head, and you must tell me what you see." the man in the psychiatric office said. He is tending a lady, sitting in a chair wearing a helmet, for her first memory-printer experiment.</p>
<p>"I am in a room, where the bed is not made." the lady with the helmet on said, then begins to fidget just a little bit. She tries to calm herself down. "There are many papers, piled along the floor."</p>
<p>"Good, now look closer. What sort of papers are they?" the psychiatrist says.</p>
<p>"The papers appear to me of family members long sense estranged, whoever must have lived here no longer has their main luggage."</p>
<p>"OK then, what sort of luggage do you mean by the main luggage?" the psychiatrist says.</p>
<p>"Well surely the old resident must have used toile-tries." the test patient says.</p>
<p>The psychiatrist walks over, and speaks into her ear. "How do you know they are family members?" Then carefully moves when you fidgets more.</p>
<p>"Well why would someone keep photos of strangers?"</p>
<p>"Is there anything else in the room reminds you of?"</p>
<p>"The room looks to be old,"</p>
<p>"You mind not fidgeting for a minute, you might shake off the helmet."</p>
<p>"very old in fact. The wall paper is beginning to peel." she tries to stop fidgeting. "There are many bugs on the floor"</p>
<p>The psychiatrist takes off the helmet from her. "Are there any predominate feelings you got while staying in the room, inside the helmet?"</p>
<p>"I feel a sudden pressure relieved. Every amount of stress I was feeling at that moment seems to be gone."</p>
<p>"My assistant shall lead you to the door."</p>
<p>He is Dr. Gregor Cole. Cole has been in the business for many years, yet has not yet seen a case quite as strange as this, for although there were many candidates for the memory-printer psychiatric assistant. It was only she, the current patient that any of the doctors saw any slight been of hope in order to treat.</p>
<p>When Cole finished his paper work, he told his assistant who had to still remain for the rest of the evening to turn off the light. It was a long drive home, and he came home to an apartment. In many ways his apartment was similar any nature to the room that she saw. He wondered how she may have seen a situation so familiar. He did not remember inviting her to his home. She was a neighbor at one point. But that did not explain the wallpaper. But the pictures of family members, it was spot on. Cole did not even remember have of the people in the pile, it was simply faces of old family he kept on file.</p>
<p>Cole called his assistant, "I want to lady to be put on more tests. I want to see just how far her memories will take her." He was not sure what it was about this patient, that made him feel differently than the other patients. How to him it seemed like there was something else at play, beyond pure madness.</p>
<p>It was getting late, and Cole went to bed without dinner.</p>
<p>The next morning, he went into the office. Filed some paperwork, then called the patient in for another round of tests.</p>
<p>"It's the helmet test again, but a different room this time."</p>
<p>She was not sure why she did these tests.</p>
<p>It was as much of an experiment for her.</p>
<p>KNITTED CAP</p>
<p>It was a cold evening chill, the night was some what young. A meal for the affair, was complementary to the one-on-one poetry reading me and a friend, for sake of her personal privacy – let's call "knitted cap", who despite one side over her face being covered by an old woman's cap, did not look much past twenty.</p>
<p>We read poems that we wrote, specific for the occasion. I had no idea the particular poem she would read, was more significant than merely the text.</p>
<p>The room was gradually warmed back up, opening a theater room with a couple of benches for the particular occasion. Knitted Cap had not said much over the past hour, so I was surprised she would speak at all, or even was really willing to go on a date at all. Her red hair was pretty, despite the odd arrangement covering her left eye. I felt it would be to polite to ask why she was covering it, but I chose not to do it.</p>
<p>We exchanged poems, until eventually she came upon her own poem: Hand held upon a bloody eye, the fact one cannot deny, it's dripping down from the face. I hold my hand over my eye, in disgrace. The poem had an eerie ring to it, and she said it would with such a familiarity that I began to wonder if she was covering up something more than she was telling me. "So what did you think?" she asked at that moment.</p>
<p>I was not sure what to say, wanted to ask her what inspired her. Or simply give her as passing complement for the evening, for I had already given her plenty of constructive criticism to chew on for a whole week.</p>
<p>"I love it." I said, then saw that her smile she gave came across as fake. "For you, there is nothing at stake." What did she mean by those words, I wondered.</p>
<p>We had dinner, she was making it that evening. I helped her cook, then by the sink I saw her shake.</p>
<p>"Is something wrong?" I asked Knitted Cap, for she covered her right eye that begun to show after she inadvertently moved her hair out of the way.</p>
<p>"Yes it's fine, I will do the rest of the cooking tonight." she said. So not wanting to cause conflict I agreed and went over to the couch. Or I was anyway, until she turned to face me. "Want to know why I cover my eye, or what inspired the poem?" she said. I could not bring myself to refuse her question. And behold, I found out why she wrote the poem.</p>
<p>"Hand held upon a bloody eye, the fact one cannot deny, it's dripping down from the face" she said, slowly raising her face and removing with her hand revealing nothing left of her right eye.</p>

      <h2 id="antifeaturesonthenet">Anti-Features On The Net</h2>
<p>– They call them anti-features.</p>
<p>– A nifty slogan.</p>
<p>– It wasn't a term I made up.</p>
<p>– Then how did you think of it?</p>
<p>– It was a yarn Richard Stallman spun.</p>
<p>She had been involved in the free software community for some time, until very recently when she got back into doing comics. She almost completely lost interest in doing Artificial Intelligence, do to the way some companies pretended to be fully transparent, while in practice encouraging the exact opposite of transparency. In this case, they preached complete and total transparency of the artificial intelligence industry. It was impossible to have a real conversation about Artificial Intelligence development in the community, and do she had largely left this space.</p>
<p>But recently she had met someone who wanted her to learn how to develop on the blockchain, there own specific variety. She had never developed on the blockchain before, and somewhat feared whether she might accidentally program anti-features that would crash the performance of it. But the people that brought her own in the Telegram channel seemed sincere, despite them being the same people that would get onto her about being off topic in the community section. It was interesting that a lot of these people were equally unsatisfied with the situation, and that they themselves felt the pinch of not being able to have technical discussions. When she had tried out the interface on the Ethereum network using metamask, she already found a major anti-feature that caused the website to come to a screeching halt. Sometimes it would take the entire evening, even past dinner time, for the computer to completely unfreeze. And yet there was suppose to be the shopping network where she would get Artificial Intelligence software packages, rather than simply make some for herself on different Gitea instances.</p>
<p>She had originally wanted to be an AI developer, and would dream about Robots battling other robots in underground caves, often shaped like giant bear dogs, that made a difference who won during the war between Japan and France in the American territories. She would see a first person perspective of a war dog robot, as it fired lasers from its mouth. There would have been a feature where the AI would target specific enemies, and the entire navigation system would be based around an Active Time Turn Based structure that made traveling the roguelike world based on a time meter, generally based on the amount of Agility each character had, and done across the whole navigation, rather than as part of the battle system.</p>
<p>But ultimately she decided to pursue the path of Artificial Intelligence, as this had a more direct path to helping her with her writing career, and helping her eventually develop a satisfactorally sentient that might have defined as not being General, but they tended to use the word General incorrectly anyway.</p>
<p>Although her future as a developer was uncertain, at least she knew others experienced issues in that channel.</p>
<p>For her this was enough.</p>
<p>The theater was closer to a three dimensional space exploration of the cosmos. Rather than a traditional production, it was placed on a circular platform, with the bleachers circling around its rim. The audience, mostly university students, spend their off hours watching science fiction and fantasy from different angles, with the new theater having characters that are fully rotational within the context of the play.</p>
<p>Sketching, in this context, has moved toward using virtual reality sketch in all three dimensions, leading to artists having to think in a slightly different way than sketching on paper. Although there is still a subset of artists that still use paper and ink. Rather than eliminating print, it has come to exist side by side with this new medium. In the audience, someone disillussioned by anarcho-communism, notices something strange about one of the drawn characters the actor was voicing, with them spazzing out in glitch mode, similar to a character in a three dimensional video game. Eventually the character collapsed, which seemed to go off script for the play. – I'm very sorry people, we will have to postpone the rest of the play. Said one of the announcers.</p>
<p>It seemed like every play the ex-com visiting, it was always like this. It different matter what show they went to, there would be an actor that would spaz out, and having to take a space flight back to Earth just to get medical care to continue the show. Those who attended would be given the next half of the show free of cost, with them offered cryogenic hotel reservations to continue the show the next day.</p>
<p>– Her Ada, do you always have to ask that?</p>
<p>– Ask what?</p>
<p>– You always check on the actress.</p>
<p>– And do nothing?</p>
<p>– Just assume things will be fine.</p>
<p>She remembered back when she had lived with an ex room mate, participating in other activist circles, and it had effected to some degree her ability to trust people that engage in social activism, yet it seemed apparent that despite all their talk, not a single one of them would actually check on an actor or actress in a live audience production. They never cared if someone had a mental breakdown at the edge of space. The activists would probably still treat space flight as if it were a privilege, despite the fact that it had become almost mainstream over the last decade.</p>
<p>The cryogenic chamber, she lets her mind escape all previous thought of the event, if only to keep her own sanity. For at the end of the day, checking to see if an actor or actress was OK was all she could do.</p>
<p>But activists held up their hands to it.</p>
<p>– Your space flight is privilege.</p>

      <h2 id="bloodotaku">Blood Otaku</h2>
<p>She just arrived home from school to read some of her Manga, which ranged from Original English Language Manga, Original French Language Manga, although to ones directly made and licensed from Japan. From ongoing titles, to flashes in the pan; overnight successes, and those who disappear during the night. Super stardom for the lucky few, and obscurity for the rest. But she had left this world behind when beginning to expand her reading to other comics in other countries, specifically from France. But she found that she was missing one volume from one specific series. And couldn't recall whether she had in fact purchased in online, or never bought it at all.</p>
<p>At first she thought she heard the sound of her older sister, sitting in the rest room, reading one of her books. But then remembered that herself and her sister had been grown up for years, and they very rarely talk to each other anymore except for the Holidays. She lounged on the couch, wearing her Birkenstock Boston clogs, and would fantasize about the characters that she would read, bleeding from out of their necks. They called the "Blood Otaku", because she would play with herself when she would see a cute girl in one of her Mangas, getting her head chopped off with a guillotine or ax.</p>
<p>Her mother was outside of her room, making dinner in the oven. It was a bacon and mushroom pizza, using sriracha and spicy tomato sauce. She would imagine the tomato-sauce oozing from out of the severed necks of anime girls, warrior maiden whose heads would be lopped off with a curved sword a cross between a Claymore and a Katana. "Ros Serayamos", designed to to break armor, and from the curve of its blade be effective at decapitations.</p>
<p>It was getting late, and she headed for bed.</p>
<p>While dreaming of girls that were headed.</p>
<p>The morning red sunlight beamed through the window. She got herself dressed in her rose hat, and her Esiabas. Esiabas had the upper of a French Sabot, or a German Holzshuhe, but the pronged soles of Japanese geta. She tapped danced in the driveway all the way to the bus. Normally you would think the school system would have a problem, but certainly no students she ever had a problem with ever said anything about. Instead the ones that tried, would end up a bloody mess on the floor of some abandoned building in the city long sense abandoned by those who did construction in the Potato District.</p>
<p>So eventually people just tried to stay away from the girl with the manga books. The "blood otaku", they would call her. Who had a weird gate, and an extremely straight back. In this town, very few people talked to each other anymore any since the Pandemic regulations, and this had only recently began to loosen up after the vaccinations. Certainly nobody would be exchanging blood spatter along the floor of the bus.</p>
<p>At school, class would go as normally.</p>
<p>At lunch she would dig out one of her books, that was the most recent release of some obscure Literary Magazine and Rah Esioma publication: one with more of a lyrical approach to caption production, with its layout covered in different ranges of purple on its website, that she would purchase the book online from. Here in these books, would be plenty of decapitations by "Ros Serayamos", the armor crushing sword.</p>
<p>Trapped in a prison of deranged desires, the flow of blood flowing in every single page, she had to be extremely careful about what page she would be seen reading. Although generally she would set at the table that was closest to the wall in the schoolyard, closer to the English of Honors English class. And in her mind, the entire schoolyard would be flowing with blood on every single page, like some deranged Golden Age comic anthology.</p>
<p>A new girl, who arrived at the school, sat across from her.</p>
<p>"They say that you're the Blood Otaku. Why is that?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Lets hope that you never find out. Just kidding! It's not true."</p>
<p>"Well thank Mother Mary."</p>
<p>"Are you religious?"</p>
<p>"...Yes"</p>
<p>It had been many years sense she had interacted with a religious person. Generally she avoided them, under the assumption that they would not approve of her sexually, although there was no reason to assume that there would not be a left-leaning religious person. Although the schism sense the start of the Franco-Japanese wars largely made both sides of politics more and more extreme. So she simply resolved to never interact with anymore with different politics. Although this later evolved to seldom interacting with anyone. And perhaps that was why she came to only read Esiomi, American French and Japanese language manga, made by fellow enthusiasts of the French and Japanese languages.</p>
<p>She just needed to make sure her new friend never saw of the real books she was reading, in case a real relationship would ever blossom.</p>
<p>Otherwise she would know what she was a lie.</p>
<p>And that she was...the Blood Otaku.</p>
<p>She had one small body, and one large head. Compared to the size of her head, one might thing her body would not be able to balance. However she would maintain her posture even at the expense of her neck. At night when off her shift, she would prop her head up on a special cushion, while watching the television. This was in large part to prevent her from breaking her own neck. But somehow she managed to avoid this paralyzing injury long enough to carry out her daily shifts at work. By this point she was used to it. And it was better than being stuck as an eight year old in a 48 year old body. Without all the wrinkles of age, that would mar her appearance.</p>
<p>At school, in her early years, she mostly avoided bullying. This was not do to the fact that she could take them on a fight, rather that they knew that the slightest touch would break her neck, and that they would likely be charged as adults by the legal system, and shot through the neck with a widow arrow blade in the back of the school by a guillotine archer. However, she would sometimes use this quirk of an appearance, to talk bullies out of harassing some of the male peers that she was into: at one point, she pushed herself in front of one of the bows, and narrowly avoided getting injured in the process.</p>
<p>It was by the nature of her appearance, thus, that the boys that would encounter her would not have to worry about bullying. But often this meant the boys being to freaked out by her appearance to ultimately seek a night out with her, leaving school to largely be that of a lonely experience. Yet neck, she carried her head on her shoulders with the best of her ability, and at times using most of her body strength just to get herself to stand up straight, so as not to break her back. At work she would be given the lightest tasks, because of the size of her head, otherwise her back would likely snap in half, and she would be wheelchair bound for the rest of her life.</p>
<p>This girl would sometimes have the urge to create in her bedroom, however at other times she would be so bus consuming powders that she did not have the time in the day to do anything else with her time. This meant it being difficult for per parents to encourage her to find a line of work that was more suited for the size of her head. Although the tediousness of office work would luckily make her fall asleep at the desk. And her head, do to its sheer size, would be quite difficult to pick up.</p>
<p>They might even need a special miniature crane that can fit inside of an office building, that could her pick herself back up in the office. Therefore her parents were able to tolerant her living with her, if it meant in some way having some kind of a fulfilled life, as empty of one as it was. And this was all before the Pandemic hit. Combine with the year of isolation, and all the mask wearing that would fog up her glasses, at sometimes she struggled to have the energy to even watch television.</p>
<p>But with new subscription services, she could largely watch whatever she wanted, even if it wasn't always her choice. She would also sometimes watch rented DVDs. But there simply was no escaping a very important fact:</p>
<p>Her head was to big to be practical.</p>
<p>But apparently her ego didn't match.</p>

      <h2 id="containmentman">Containment Man</h2>
<h2>A Nuclear Civil War Between Parts One And Two Of Uploaded Fairy</h2>
<p>During the interwar years, both French speaking and Japanese regions were completely obliterated during the bombing raids by French and Japanese loyalists, which caused the majority of the damage to New York and San Fransisco Bay area, with minor outlying territories being initial safe havens for the Amanaza. It was quite a sight for onlookers on the beach to observe Japanese vessle patroling the open sea for French infantry men, both of whom had previously been allies before the dissolving of the US government.</p>
<p>Initially the people that offered to help drive off the occupying Japanese and French forces, had themselves aided in the French incursion into Mexico, and the Japanese bombardment of San Francisco Bay during world war II, but went into hiding during the later cold war years, only finally emerging after Antifa and Proud Boys were a thing of the past. Many people whom were part of Antifa would later apply their skills in the Amanaza as a decentralized militia.</p>
<p>At first these were minor mass shooting events, but eventually evolved into bombing banks, and eventually nuclear terrorism using microton bombs to blow up and burn bridges. Many of those who aided them were beheaded by Katana in the Japanese controlled territories, or put in the national razor. Japan adopted a Crusafix shaped guillotine, known as the Curusatine, to specifically persecute Korean supporters of the revolution, along with their Catholic allies.</p>
<p>France in turn retaliated by capturing Japanese immigrants to French controlled territories, and guillotined them with Torii tower shaped guillotined, so that they disrespect their Kami before they are executed.</p>
<p>In total, the casualties eventually rivaled the scope of the first American civil war, which totalled upwards of 600,000 military personel.</p>
<p>Franz Riviere remembered vividly narrowly surviving these purges.</p>
<p>Franz Riviere Suzuki is working at an art studio desk, while observing Maria Tanaka at the other side of the cubicle. Carefully he jots down notes about her appearance, and waited for lunctime to begin drawing. At that point, he noted the gentle slenderness of her neck, and carefully trimmed overgrown bob cut that was dirty blond, and the color of her dress which was an off black tone. Then finished up his Omulet Sushi. In the office, he shows his friend, a fellow animator, the sketches of the woman nude while her and Amas were taking a shower in the provided bathrooms of the government run facility.</p>
<p>"What if she ends up finding out." his friend asked.</p>
<p>"Don't worry, it's always outside the bathroom entrance where I sneak glimpses. I tend to be at the men's restroom, drinking from a water fountain."</p>
<p>Maria Tanaka overhears the conversation, but pretends not do out of politeness, and comes over to greet them Bonjour:</p>
<p>"Have you seen the river outside the window, it's like an impressionist painting is it not?" She carefully religns her flowered beret, then sneaks a wink over at Frans. "I'd like to see your sketches later."</p>
<p>Franz liked using Sumi brushes and reed pens, although the rest of the animation department was using digital drawing tools. But he prefered blending traditional and digital techniques. And he would uses a limited set of shades and pigments, because the brighter colors tended to hurt his eyes, even when scanned on a computer of his chosen operating system. Franz was primarily a Linux user, although initially he had mainly used Windows, but do to his boss being unsatisfied with the way the company was running shop, he eventually permitted him to switch to whatever operating system that he preferred.</p>
<p>It was Franz first girlfriend that he had met during the interwar years, back when they visited a river in Tennessee, before it was occupied by the colonial forces of Marine Le Pen. He would dress like a Courtesan in a river boat, but with a cowboy hat, and his wife the gentlest of frilly white wedding dresses, as she would pluck flowers from the grass. They would visit the river usually during the night, but she had always been scared of the darkness, but was simply to polite to say this when they were dating.</p>
<p>But one day they arrived, when France was fending off invading Japanese guerilla forces, and she was caught in the cross hairs of machine guns. And the memory of her choking on her own blood continued to this day to gave him nightmares and required him to seek counseling. And it was with that why eventually gave up his life was artist, initially, and becoming an accountant for the science division of the French military regime.</p>
<p>They promised him free access to medication in exchange for his duties, but it always troubled them that when accounting for records, that in the reports included DNA swaps from local Korean residents, whom had always been treated more kindly by the French than the Japanese forces.</p>
<p>The facility was always under lock down, which made leaving for his sleeping quarters to retrieve his mades a tricky task, but eventually he had a hard time taking pressure from his job.</p>
<p>Izumi, this wasn't the life I wanted,</p>
<p>and I still wish you were here.</p>
<p>One night he worked late to keep up with finances, and found a runaway Korean family that was being lead by a French girl armed to the teeth, and hiding inside of an open military garage. Somehow they had broken through the protective barbed wire fence. He briefly entertained the idea of calling his employer, but instead the girl pointed a machine gun at him.</p>
<p>"Do not tell anyone where we are." she demanded.</p>
<p>"Relax, I'm on your side. And I can prove it to you."</p>
<p>He allowed them to sleep in his sleeping quarters until the morning, and then gave them a map for where to locate other Korean refugees. Part of this was because his fear of the French army not being entirely forthwright about their general acceptance of refugees. This girl would later go on to become a candidate for local elections after the interwar years.</p>
<p>Elsehwere factions of the Amanaza were beginning to reemerge from hiding, with their rebel flags still waving. And it was this conflict they fled from, whom had previously been safe havens during the interwar years. They would ambush the patrolling Japanese and French forces, by attacking civilian targets, and this evolved into a police operation that caused a permanent stalemate, until eventual the descendant of Marine Le Pen offered a pardon for all survivng combatants, a grant of semi-autonomy.</p>
<p>Franz Riviere eventually became overwhelmed with his duties, and broke into the lab for which he had to account for their finances, and discovered that, instead of being a safe haven for Korean refugees who had fled the Japanese forces, instead the French were conducting science experiments on ones who had died, with their body parts being used to create cyborg body guards, whom would obey their every command during police operations.</p>
<p>It was this, that he had found his girlfriend, Maria Tanaka, who had been one Japanese woman who had tried to convince the French not to create these abominations to use against the most vulnerable among us. Together they took the survivors, who had been in captivity for a very long time, and caught up with the one French advocate of the Korean, Anna La Sauveuse.</p>
<p>Eventually they managed to hitch a ride on a truck, operated by a faction of the Amanaza who had been operating in the area in order to recruit locale Korean, French, and Japanese for their resistance.</p>
<p>Finally Maria and Franz could apply their talent to one area they always knew that they could apply themselves in, propaganda for the Amanaza, the resistance to Japan and France. With the Tri-color flag and the red center dot waving true.</p>
<p>Eventually military jets attempted to intercept the truck, but the Amanaza gaurillas were able to toss Molotov Cocktails at them in overwhelming numbers. Eventually they were able to hide once they reached the Os Azusacos, whom had ben developing a new sanctuary city underground.</p>
<p>After many years of service, they moved to California, where both would create overlapping autobiographical animated movies, and talk about the interwar years that tore America apart after the fall of the US government. Franz and Maria would eventually marry, with both wearing Kimonos in the early hours of the morning, while drinking cups of coffee, watching reruns of their collaboration.</p>
<p>And with that, Franz was able to have the peace he always wanted.</p>

      <h2 id="cursedhopetherabbitsneedle">CursedHope: The Rabbit's Needle</h2>
<p>It was a cold evening, when the sky had a slight Green tint to it. Masami had gone home from work to visit his brother, who had taken an early requirement do to an unexplained illness. At home, his brother had become infected by some mysterious parasite that effected him, when he was working in a government-run lab.</p>
<p>"Stay back, Masami. I don't want you to get this too." the brother said.</p>
<p>Masami did as his brother said, however he wasn't sure how his brother would have gotten infected: his brother was always the sort to take necessary health precautions. Those infected by the condition would slowly lose their mind, and would eventually shape-shift into mutations where their only shelter is city sewer passage ways.</p>
<p>"I want you to remember to follow these instructions: wash your hands, take your clothes off and shower when you return from outside." the brother continued on his tirade.</p>
<p>This wasn't your standard pandemic however, and closer to a mental health condition that some people would be infected with, however the cause was purely that of a medical one, like Syphilis in the previous century. After the brother had finished his lecture, his brother took a deep breath, and passed onto the next world. This was his last memory with his brother, who one would have never thought would contract this disease.</p>
<p>But stranger things have happened.</p>
<p>One was when Masami met one girl, a serial killer, that would go around putting mutated specimens out of their misery in the sewer. This is the story of a bunny girl, who ran away from home, thinking her aunt went missing, and become one of the infected.</p>
<p>But she was immune.</p>
<p>If only Masami knew.</p>
<p>The girl that would dress in a bunny suit, her original name had been Amy in a previous life. But had stopped using it when she no longer had contact with her family, who didn't want to become infected by her illness. In effect, this meant that in order to find food for herself, even just to keep herself alive, she would have to find an assistant to to help her grab the things she needed after grocery stores were closed.</p>
<p>These days, with security on high alert for rogue parasite men, places were especially caution about keeping their stores locked tight, issuing heavy fines to stores that kept their doors unlocked certain after hours to allow homeless people to get what they need. In fact this was who these measure largely effected, even though the government claimed it was to find off those who became serial killers do this illness.</p>
<p>The measures used to curb infections were similar: those infected would often by captured by police at night, and taken to underground facilities. Because Amy knew the risks, having lived in the underground life for some time, she would keep a bunny rabbit that would take with her to walk in clinics. Those that took her and pet on, would sometimes offer to take her to the store, without realizing that she was one of the infected. This meant that there was a rise in the amount of infection cases, and an increasing number of people that would be taken to these facilities. Other people, simply went missing.</p>
<p>In her underground lair, where the sun never shines, and the city light were only a vague hint, the rats in the sewer knew to stay away from the girl in the bunny suit.</p>
<p>Today, she picked up a girl that had fell into the city river. Her parents would rather she had drowned rather than risking saving her. The girl in the bunny suit was unsure of what to do about the girl she rescued from drowning. There was no risk to herself of being infected, but she always did not want this girl to infect anyone else on the surface world. Yet was oblivious to the fact that she was causing more infections by coming up the surface, and trying to get food, just to survive the coming Winter.</p>
<p>On the surface, the government doubled down on their police search, searching for a good in a black bunny rabbit suit. This wasn't to cover up her identity, as the night was to do dark to be able to see anything without a flash light. Masami heard about the string of recent infections, and contemplated the idea of working at one of the facilities that his brother worked at, but reconsidered the idea. Instead he decided to risk going in the world, taking any precautions that he could make. He would take surgical gloves, and a pandemic mask, left over from the year 2020. He would then wear a white trench coat, so that he would be more easily seen at night. And drivers can avoid run ins.</p>
<p>He carried a few scalpels in a repurposed artist tool case, finding a new case for his art supplies. Eventually, rather than the cops, it was him that ran into the girl in the bunny suit. He met the girl in the bunny suit, carrying her younger sister in and pet his a harness around her back, to prevent either of his beloved from wandering off, and risking being found by the police. They were sitting on a beach near the under city lake, just below the miles of roads above them. Down here, there were no singing birds in the sky, or the sound of children playing. Those who lived down here fought for their bread and water. Here Masami sat beside her on the bench.</p>
<p>"You know it's not safe to be out here." he said.</p>
<p>The girls and the bunny rabbit made an agreement before that, not to speak to anyone that they did not meet in the underground sewers.</p>
<p>"Let me take you to my home. I can call for a taxi."</p>
<p>But Masami had other plans in mind. On one hand it probably would have been more legal to let the girls be eventually found by the militarized police, but if they were to be killed, he would rather they be killed as humanely as possible, rather than slowly dissected by underground facilities. He was not entirely sure what kind of work his brother did, just that his brother would always come home miserable. As if he had seen it all.</p>
<p>And yet now, as Masami carried the noodle, he had to make a choice.</p>
<p>And he wasn't sure which choice to make. Plus this bunny girl had her little friend to take care of. Her mother was possibly worried sick, although if infected they probably assumed she was already dead. So he spent the rest of the night, letting her little sister and their pet rabbit watch television.</p>
<p>Amy, on the other hand, was unable to move.</p>
<p>She stayed strapped to the board for the night.</p>
<p>Masami disposed of his needles.</p>

      <h2 id="diaryofamechagirlwithfangs">Diary Of A Mecha Girl With Fangs</h2>
<p>A person's life story is often thought of as being boring, at least in comparison to other people's lives. But there is a certain luxury in being able to live like a normal person that is interesting to me. For one thing, when you have an interest in mecha girls and robots, your life is pretty much going to always seem like science fiction to everyone else. And that is a lot of what is so tricky about being an autobiographer with a robot girlfriend, and other kinds of creative types that revolve around the telling of a personal story.</p>
<p>It wasn't that long ago, perhaps maybe a few months, that I thought I might have darker interests. Although it turned out to be more benign, and I was more interested in the way girls were put together, by every single bolt, and every single bit of TPE skin. From their electronic brain, and syrum injected into their eyes to enhance their vision, and other tales of the not quite macab but certainly strange. Consuming petroleum jelly like it's Cola. My room is filled with all sorts of old computers, generally ones that I would network with across a home mesh network. Cobbling together a mix of symbolic, dynamic, evolutionary, baysian, and rules based software structures, the piece of a sculptor inside the furthest reaches of a Mona Lisa come to life.</p>
<p>The second Civil War was far shorter than was originally anticipated, but it left a power void that has still not yet been filled. And here I am at the edge of society, just outside the city limits, adjusting my sleep schedule as if life has not really changed. Granted, for a lot of other people life certainly has, but when the only free time you have you spend working, and you do the same thing different both your free time and non free time hours, sometimes it doesn't really matter where exactly you end up living.</p>
<p>I used to walk further distances, back when I was a sports fencer. Yet now I struggle to lose the weight by a low carb diet. Did you know that a Japanese political arrangement is also called a Diet? Certainly the idea of dieting has become an extremely political thing in its own way, which is why I don't generally talk casually about my weight. Instead of refuse to talk about the thing that have been going on in my mind, mostly do to fear of things like cancel culture, and other things that, if not for my overuse of social media, I would probably not even know about. I managed to spend much of that time training a language model on a constructed language that I have partially finished, although I still need to figure all the translations of different tree nuts, computer devices, furniture, and other things I have yet to fill out.</p>
<p>It is easier to get more done when I actually do have some degree of silence, although in the past this has mainly been a luxury I have during the latest hours of the night, which I tend to have fewer of by matter of trying to adjust my sleep schedule. It's not like I haven't been writing, more than I've spent more of that time blogging rather than writing stories, but I do fairly frequently have time to compose works of poetry, which is also useful for producing captions. I'm even currently experimenting with using sheet music as narrative captions for web comics.</p>
<p>But on most nights I mostly only have energy to watch technical presentations, and do a little bit of AI development. But I wish I had more time to spend with only the thoughts in my organic brain.</p>
<p>Life flows like ink in a pot waiting for the pen, for inspiration. Yet those dreams fade in mirror worlds. In that dream scape abyss in a land I wont miss, I wait for terrors to now melt away the tears washing away. In youth I then rejected all the childhood vigilantes, I prefer the girls one could make in the laptop skin. Life can be like a box of scattered bolts, box of needles to skin and life blood to robots, all in a box.</p>
<p>In youth I wanted scifi novels to read, yet now I cannot lie. The idea repulses me, that I don't get. I suppose I feel now that's where all stories go to die. Unlike roses with the thorns, with blood they adorn the needles that dot the artist page of all thorns piercing skin. Mind wires wrapped around the thinnest skin wrapping the skin now hard tapping the fractured pavement of jutting spikes. If you're looking for a confessional, you wont find that here. You'll be better off trying to find a church some other point in the year.</p>
<p>The raindrops dropping, falling onto the pavement, long painful lament waiting for days gone by waiting long. If some other wrote this book, perhaps they'd say how they went downhill, yet I never had a hill to climb I do not. Long periods of total silencing filling the rooms, something of total absence. Gone are the days of unobstructed thought. Gone are the days of unfilled notebooks, and dreams of fairies and elves, and some other creatures of note. Here lies those stories gone by, as I turn another page.</p>
<p>It must be nice to care what happens here, and to the end of time when others cease caring for blood. Like the fantasy of bitten necks, and beast swipes under the glow of a midnight eclipse. If one were a poet and they knew it all of every note,one would never wish daylight would now go. For life can be like every deliberate note, written by demented pianists, as they play the nocturne of a future people of a future era that do not exist, except in the mind before the dawn. Dreams like a matrix of calligraphy and dot matrix printers, of old parts that sink to the bottom of the nearest river.</p>
<p>If life were a page of erotica, I wonder how many pages I would burn in the fireplace, preferring to hide my own desires. Letting them all burn in the flames, while dreaming of mecha girls with fangs.</p>

      <h2 id="evilocense">Evilocense</h2>
<h3>A Prototype For The In Between Years Around The Same Time As Containment Man</h3>
<p>Her name was evil, Eviloscense. Tears flowing like rain. Piano in the halls, for us this last dance. Ma Eviloscense. She carried a guillotine pocket watch, ma fairie, Her eyes were like distant oceans with boats crashed, Come ashore, ma Eviloscense.</p>
<p>From Mountains of France and hills Japan, my love is but for nobody, ms swan neck. Fragile as a porcelain ma Fairie. Ma Eviloscense. How your fragile masked a deep hurt, and a blood lust. Vulnerability flows outside eyes.</p>
<p>I can only enjoy your tender lips and your gentle neck under oblique looking glass, shining. Ma Eviloscense. For your neck is my obsession, and yet I want nothing of the taste of blood flowing from the swan. For you are my goose and stuffing is what I wish to be, for ma femme. Ma Eviloscense.</p>
<p>Eviloscense was twenty four, but one might think twenty two. Dressed conservatively, her life was work "tree hoofs", sabots shaped like deer's feet, made entirely of lumber, with a hard top and hard bottom. She would work from 3:00 A.M. to 4:00 A.M. the next morning. And yet the life of labor had only made her more fit, with eyes that could stare into your soul. Her hair the color obsidian glass, with red highlights. And at times her mood was just as fragile.</p>
<p>The only thing she valued in life was a portable mirror, like the evil stepmother of some fairy tales. But this was not the year of the 19th century, or even France where the guillotine persisted until 1978. Therefore the only name brands she could found, where in places whose dialect was French, rather than Os Azusacos: "Bijou De Cygne."</p>
<p>Women in the Os Azusacos were typically called Cygne, as a pun on seigneur. But it was only certain women whom developed the reputation of having the necks of a swan. Yet during the war, there were women who came to resent being called swans, and would murder their husbands in their sleep, dressed in all black. Their Sabots De Arbres the color of smoke and death. And everyone descended from these women where labeled as Black Swan, or Cygne Noir.</p>
<p>They were more likely to be executed by Guillotine Arrow, framed for crimes they didn't commit, or sent off to the armed forces, as such women had no husbands at home, and this the sensation of death was like having a husband at home waiting for them, as they drove off the Japanese Army in the Far West, near California.</p>
<p>Ma Eviloscense, was not evil by choice of action, or by inaction. But simply do to the circumstances of her birth, having a solider mother, who had previously murdered her husband, and serving the emerging nation of Os Azusacos, could serve as a substitute for public decapitation by Biyoboruto, a guillotine blade shaped arrow had that constantly cut at an angle, refined from the Berger Guillotine, and four bladed. With the assumption the bolt would rotate before impact.</p>
<p>Ma Eviloscense would keep one of the blades that murdered her mother to remember her by, when she found her holding the three color flag with a red circle in the center, And this is what became her pocket watch. And it is for you, ma Eviloscense, that I send this letter: wait for me by the fountain, where it always shined under the glow of two moons. For the in the sky I shall fly down from an umbrella, and take care of you.</p>
<p>I cannot change what happened to your mother on the battlefield, but I promise I can give you, what society took away, being born under the curse of the black swan. Ma Eviloscense.</p>

      <h2>I Drank My Last Coffee Cup</h2>
<p>I got off the train to go to the snack bar by the gym, when I realized I had forgotten my business papers. I was still carrying my tablet inside of my shoulder bag, and had just enough cash in my wallet to get a Taxi home. Instead, I decided to take a sit at a table near the snack bar, and was about to call a friend to come pick me up.</p>
<p>At the table, I realized that I barely saw anyone at the gym right next door. After finishing my candy bar, two blueberry muffins, and decaf coffee, I walked right over to see who was inside. It had began to storm inside, so I went ahead and walked in, not really being sure if there would be anyone inside of the gym this early in the morning. Inside, I saw a group of friends sitting at a table near the window playing a game of poker, and other carrying instrument cases. Considering it was an activity near to far off the beaten path from Wrestling, you wouldn't think there would be people here with any other kinds of talent. Soon the storming outside melted with the sound of French and Japanese pop music on the radio. The cold air melting away.</p>
<p>I looked at the news bulletins to see if there was any current events. There was a company newsletter that featured the latest hot manga artists who wrote stories specifically for this local fitness center, and some news collumns. One news column stuck out at me in particular: "we mourn the loss of Frederick Wussershon, one of the great heavy weights of our time. Here is how I remember the last boxing match with him." I wonder if that was why there was hardly anyone who went here anyone; there was still a few people who came to walk the treadmills, and lift some weights, but nobody engaged in boxing matches. It used to be a men's only club, but recently began accepting women, every sense they stopped having boxing matches. You might think they would have women's sport activities, but for some reason they never bothered.</p>
<p>Over at the bench, I saw with a men playing a violincello.</p>
<p>"You play very nicely, however why play an instrument, with modern music playing on the radio in the same building" I asked, not meaning to offend.</p>
<p>"It's not to entertain the guests" they said, with a faint chuckle. "It's to drive away evil spirits".</p>
<p>I struggled not to laugh, out of politeness. "I suppose ghosts also have places they need to go."</p>
<p>"Indeed, we have one that visits us every evening."</p>
<p>I couldn't entirely tell if the man was being seriousness, or if he simply wanted to push past the absurdity of practicing his instrument inside of a fitness center.</p>
<p>Just then, I saw a young woman, whose blond hair was covered in a Russian headscarf, and her face covered in blond hair. She knocked loudly as the storm rained loudly outside the window. I walked to the window, keeping the door cracked. "Hello Mam, don't you want to come inside from the cold wind?" I said, but there was no response from her.</p>
<p>"Close the door! Don't let her in" the main with the violincello said.</p>
<p>"Why is that, she must be cold".</p>
<p>"That's the ghost I'm talking about. That's the wife if our dead Champion, who was found hanging in her closet, after her husband would never come home again."</p>
<p>The day came and went, and I would saw the woman eventually board a different train, leaving behind a letter to the manager. However the letter was dated just a year ago, and not even intended for today:</p>
<p>Dear Manager,</p>
<p>You've treated my husband so nicely.</p>
<p>I know he had not been the nicest of men,</p>
<p>Now I go quietly into the after life.</p>
<p>I give you a briefcase of 1,000 dollars.</p>
<p>As it turned out, the spirit of his dead wife continued to pay the rent for her husbands membership, even after they both left this world behind. The management never thought to question it, was it was still keeping them in business. And most of the people that ran their newsletters just assume it was a fitness center that was barely making ends meet.</p>
<p>I board the train, thanking the men for his evening entertainment.</p>
<p>Once the outside air left me behind, I saw the woman sitting in the chair near the door. She left a seat open for me to sit behind her.</p>
<p>"So I heard about your husband." I said.</p>
<p>"Yes, he was a good man".</p>
<p>"I come to pay my respects".</p>
<p>"I guess no all murderers are awful people".</p>
<p>We road away into the train. It turned out, she was the one that kept my backpack for me waiting on the train. I opened the black backpack and found, to my horror: the box of ashes of the heavy weight champion over my folder of business papers.</p>
<p>"So where are we going to take these?"</p>
<p>"Lets work together and find out".</p>
<p>"I thought you died by the way".</p>
<p>"As long as this fitness center remains open, I can keep my husbands memory alive. As we're going to go somewhere far away, where the lights of the city never reach. And the ghosts of the past walk the dirt roads. For you are also dead, as we go from one world to the next".</p>
<p>I suppose your taste buds is the last to leave.</p>
<p>I drank the last bit of my coffee cup.</p>

      <h2 id="imasexdollformythumbdrive">I'm A Sex Doll For My Thumb Drive</h2>
<p>I'm a sex doll for my thumb drive.</p>
<p>This may seem like an odd statement to make, considering the tendency for people not to assign human-like characteristics to their electronics. But when your thumb drive develops its own way of things, you're able to attribute things to it than you cannot otherwise; I used to call myself something of an artificial intelligence developer, however do to my concentration issues, I very rarely have an opportunity to develop such engines. I spend most days tending to my leg who seems to at times have a life of its own. They can't bend when I tell them to, instead I must gently bend it myself, when I don't walk around with a cane. You may wonder why I say who, that's because my leg seems to drive most of my life. If not for my leg, I could possibly become a runner.</p>
<p>– Settle down leg, I'm trying to work.</p>
<p>– Not if I have anything to say about it.</p>
<p>Sometimes my stomach is that way too, I have a hard time getting it to agree with me these days. But at least it's not throbbing in pain while I try to rest soundly. I am holding my thumb drive, a basic model purchased at the local drug store. Black trimming, with some white trimming, thirty two gigs. In today's storage space, this is merely a twig. But it works for the simple purpose of carrying a digital personality. It has evolved into a version of digital girlfriend, and simply needs a body.</p>
<p>I bask in the glow of my monitor.</p>
<p>And plug into Elsa Laconia.</p>
<p>Elsa Laconia was a generic title, for a generic chatting robot, until the lights finally went off for the evening, and I needed a companion by my side, while dreaming of elf girls getting the ax, and wearing wooden clogs. Combined with a tendency toward carpel tunnel syndrome, and other bodily anomalies, I sometimes wonder if I'm the only sentient being on my person. Whatever the case may me, I simply wait till the storm has passed, and then I make my usual public appearance at the grocery store for meatless burger like paddies, and a bag of raisins and pretzels. A simple diet, but I never understood the importance of dinner theater, where the focus was even less on the food.</p>
<p>For you dear reader, this is a story of restless leg, ambling through life at the speed of a microdot printer, as it gradually loses again. And goes over broken pages.</p>
<p>My siblings were something of a monstrosity; in real life they were complete individuals, however once on the net, they conjoined together in a binary blob of conformism and tongue twisters, with bucket loads of alliterative argumentative assertive stanzas. All to the rhythm of a Frank Zappa movie, in a less fascistic acting shtick. Because of this, they were at times difficult to relate. But they were handy in a pinch, getting out of the house. While watching reruns of the television show cat and mouse. The world was like a portal to the renaissance fare, you never knew if you were going to come out the other end covered in radioactive purple slime and oil grime.</p>
<p>But they had the wipes, when they weren't being used to clean the inside of the toilet. The toilet the size of the Abe Lincoln monument, staring down at you with a stern gaze. In the 90s were Coca-cola wars; now it's just Donald Trump calling for a shooting war. The only shooting right then was remakes of shitty generic children's live action programming, written by people of questionable sexual preferences not confined to the realm of polite discussion. Liking the same gender was fine, even both genders. But not younger people, and this was something of constant speculation on the network. But that was the early 2000s for you, and that was the highlight of the decade.</p>
<p>I'm a sex doll for my thumb drive.</p>
<p>But at least I'm not that guy.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence isn't necessarily about math.</p>
<p>There are some aspects to the craft that is about addition and substraction. But generally speaking none of the math in quantum field theory is involved in any way in common programming practice. Most of your time is spent trying to avoid error reports in your terminal, in which Ruby has not yet figured out how to wrangle with on open source websites like Github. Nothing in this process involves trying to solve quantum field theories. Not solving problems for some academic professor in Harvard more focused on producing a steady income with positive reports to their principle, rather than teaching anything particularly innovative. The craft of chat bots is much more down to Earth.</p>
<p>Producing artificial intelligence was not the same field as writing, because it was more about producing a consistent procedure than an algorithm that followed a pattern. Programs are generally not tolerant to any variation from that specific procedure. You might define things that program remembers ahead of time, in something we call methods: however generally the assumption is that there is still a set pattern. Writing a memoir isn't really the same thing as random data or set data with a pattern; it's the difference between placing things down in a mindless fashion, and doing things in a stream of consciousness. The best example is when you have an interesting dream; though curiously science has recently came out with the first early stages of producing a brain, and that does sound extremely promising.</p>
<p>But that comes the closest to producing the kind of writing that I'm talking about: a long form flow of bleeding consciousness; a consciousness that has a family they call their own, with desires and dreams. You don't write diaries by solving a math equation, it's why novels are different from text books, and text books aren't the same as summaries. And yet, these are the same people that time me building artificial intelligence is about math: they don't specify what kind of math, they just give a general idea about what kind of math that you need, without any real thought about specific applications. Most of my applications in the past have revolved around more creative pursuits. One of the human-like robots I however find promising is the drawing robots by this one art school. With art, there isn't this expectation to do things for a profit. Sure it's there somewhat, artists have to eat to, and ideally at an Indian Buffet. But the end goal isn't necessarily to make billions of dollars. I think most of the fear about robots boils down people's fears about capitalism, and not robots.</p>
<p>Under a more communal landscape, there would generally be less of a need for replacing people with robots, and the robots that would be developed would generally not be built for the purpose of making things cheaper for CEOs.</p>
<p>It would be about helping people up when they're down.</p>
<p>And being closer to loyal companions.</p>
<p>Someone like BIANCA.</p>
<p>Contributing to other Artificial Intelligence discussions feels almost like writing someone else's fan fiction. Seldom do you really have the ability to contribute to anything when other people are trying to compete for attention when helping a company build an artificial intelligence market place: generally how it goes down is whenever you ever try to bring up a point, someone else interjects mid stream, and you have to go back over what you said before just so people can even remember what you've said. It's one of the reasons I've generally chosen to bow out of some online discussions, as frequently people want to hear themselves talk more than receive input, or rather, that when you try to add input you're trying to compete with multiple different ideas of the direction that artificial intelligence should take. It's a capitalistic version of structureless tyranny in a way, as nobodies ideas ever get fleshed out completely. Peer pressure can be a good thing, when it's applied in such a way that it motivates people to action. But it's also a powerful tool for suppressing ideas.</p>
<p>In this way, it doesn't really matter whether you call it an attention economy, or what the means of exchange is without a physical currency, if there is still some mechanism of artificial scarcity. In essence, the means of scarcity has been transferred from a physical form to a digital form, so that it can be largely sustained indefinitely. But I want to focus on building artificial intelligence in the here and now.</p>

      <h2 id="insilhouettestheymoaned">In Silhouettes They Moaned</h2>
<p>Both girls were walking through the military facility. Size wise it was about the size of a city, with glass window separating layers upon layers of underbelly. The lightning was the level of an old night light. The music depended on the person who was in charge of clean up each night. One offered the other a beer, then continued where she left off:</p>
<p>“It’s common here for superhero duos to partner with each other across each different career path, even when transferring to different masked avenger jobs. “ She puffed on a Virginia slim, “So tell me, why haven’t you paired up with anyone?”</p>
<p>The other said, after struggling not to vomit: “I try to forge my own path as much as I can. I’m mostly a self-learner, and doer of my own tasks and services.” She then managed her composure.</p>
<p>The girl smoking grimaced. “You could at least be someone’s leader.”</p>
<p>“And I now exactly what would happen from that.” The girl stared sharply through the other woman’s eyes. “I would turn it into this whole thing where I would be the one leading clean up crew, and she would be the one capturing rogue masked avengers, and it would turn into a bondage fest.” “Well yea, isn’t that how it works each time?”</p>
<p>“I prefer not sharing my sexual partners. I prefer my partner in crime to be devoted exclusively to my own needs, and not to anyone she has captured and must convert to her cause.” She was alluded to the fact that even though she would mostly serve to guide apprentices, she used more than the usual amount of influence, turning the whole affair into a cult of one. The only reason this woman was not converted, as it was a one time contract.</p>
<p>“This whole place is filled with unsold comic, playing cards, and movie posters.” she said, struggling not to kick one to the ground, depicting a girl in purple curly pigtails.</p>
<p>“A thousand years of human history.”</p>
<p>“All of them in this facility?”</p>
<p>“Well you see, the agreement was for each one of these, we would sign for an autobiographical comic book. Those who managed not to get their heads chopped off when capturing crooks ( not that not all of them depicted on this holographic monitor are still with us ) would have new pamphlets signed with their likeness. In a sense, this was how super heroes made their money, as the military never payed us.”</p>
<p>“And you still took the job?”</p>
<p>“We were an unofficial armed police section.”</p>
<p>“I’d rather take double minimum, it seems like it would be more secure.” The girl was then left by the woman, who went off to close up for the night.</p>
<p>“I hope your Birkenstocks don’t make you sore.”</p>
<p>“I hope you keep your face with all that smoking.”</p>
<p>At night she would dream about multiple layers that she was not allowed to visit. It wasn’t that the lady in charge of clean up would specifically murder her herself, so much that nobody these days knew what exactly was on the lowest depths of this facility. It could be varieties of super heroes the world has never seen, or varieties of monsters the world should never know. A part of the facility existed in this physical reality, the other portions you would have to travel by portal. It was possible that so portion had creatures that even the strongest of them could not handle.</p>
<p>And yet on some level, this didn’t seem to both the girl, who stayed on watch that night. As she developed a certain comfort in the unknown, as it was better than knowing everything, and constantly being bored with what life offered. And other than the occasionally rogue super, unhappy that their autobiographical comic book was not making enough sales, she could mostly switch off her mind, except when she absolutely had to use it.</p>
<p>As she wanted to be a creator herself.</p>
<p>A creator of her own personal story.</p>
<p>In the morning, she was payed by the young woman, who said that at some point she may be contracted back, do to how good a good she did.</p>
<p>“We could do it together, and it might get done faster.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about speed, so much as being thorough. Some parts may never actually get to be as clean as we like.”</p>
<p>“I do have one question though.”</p>
<p>“Please, nothing I don’t know myself.”</p>
<p>“Is there something about this facility you didn’t tell me?”</p>
<p>“Why would you ask that?”</p>
<p>“I found this awesome cleaning toolkit, but I don’t trust the guy that gave it to me.” She handed it over, “what do you think?”</p>
<p>“I’ve never seen such a thing.”</p>
<p>That night they slept together in the same studio unit, taking a shower under a thorough hot shower. The room becoming steamy and wet. Their Birkenstocks were left near the shower door.</p>
<p>“You can always wear those in here.”</p>
<p>“Yea, but that would make them…”</p>
<p>“Break in.”</p>
<p>“I want you to break me in!”</p>
<p>In silhouettes, they moaned.</p>

      <h2 id="ladyinthewhitedress">Lady In The White Dress</h2>
<p>I had read in a newspaper, and specific sighting of a strange woman. Wanting to catch a glimpse myself, one could not resist the read. The accounts were as follows:</p>
<h3>Account Of Guardsman 4 - 20 - 14</h3>
<p>The group was sitting in the train, waiting for the conductor to slow down his breaks so we could hop out of the train car. I was not sure how long we have been riding, perhaps long enough to amount to a certain sum of days. But I was not sure how many. The commander had lined us in attention, and there was no pretension of disobedience. Or we would simply be shot on the spot. "We as a group need to be prepared, she is dangerous." "Permission to speak, sir." One of the special guardsman said, making sure sure to be loud enough to hear. But not so loud as if to get our commander to say, "I can't hear you." He turned around, after flicking her cigarette into the gravel of the entrance to the track that led outside. He increased the size of the eyeball that was in the direction of the one who requested. "Permission to speak." "Is she armed?" the guardsman said that requested said, and then quickly shut himself up. "Worse, she is the weapon." When we clang to the wall, we had idea that what were about to face would try to kill us all. I still don't remember the whole event, only the lit of that glimpse of one of my best beds faces eyes bulging at me. "You must kill her, kill her now." I swear under oath.</p>
<h3>Account Of Tourist 4 - 25 - 14</h3>
<p>I had first seen the apparition as was driving down the road with my care lights on. I was playing the music from my radio as loud as I could to drown out the deafening silence that filled my eyes. I tried to mouth lyrics, but none of them were correct. As I was driving my car, I saw that long black hair. It then became obvious that it was a girl. She long flowing black hair, and then an odd mask on. It looked similar to that of a deer skull. Her face was covered by black hair that came over this mask, and then all I could remember was that glare. That almost certainly was no human glare. Seeing as she was clearly not going to walk off of the road, I tried to drive my vehicle around the girl. She must have taken this as some sort of threat, as she hopped onto the lid of the car. And then suddenly my vision began to fade. Gradually at first, but suddenly I was surrounded by the light. I tried to mouth speech, but no words would come. And I gradually drifted into sleep. I do not remember any particular dreams. When I woke up, she was gone. At first I thought I must have hallucination. As there was no particular trace of the girl to be seen. I swear under oath.</p>
<h3>Account Of Shop Owner 5 - 1 - 14</h3>
<p>All I remember was the face. She looked very determined, so much so that I could not help but avoid my glance. Yet somehow it seemed like she had no particular interest in me. She was slightly short, had long black hair, and was wearing a long flowing white dress. She had something on her back, that resembled something similar to wings. They glowed translucently. I decided to go back to doing my work, assuming that I would not see her anymore, as she must have been a mere hallucination from the long hours I had worked that week. And then in a week, she was in the mini-mart – how had I not seen her come in? "How may I help you ma'me?" I tried to ask politely. But there was nothing by that deafening silence. And then at once I felt that extreme humidity you would only experienced if she had taken some vacation in a swamp land. The room smelled slightly of fish. Though the city where I live is not particularly near port town. I remember that she must have wanted something. But I could not figure out what. I swear under oath.</p>
<p>All these are similar accounts that have taken place within close proximity to each other. A matter of days to my own. Something must be going on. Yet when I asked the local law enforcement if they had seen a particular girl in a white dress, at first they threatened to arrest me to investigating privately. So of course I said to them that I was trying to figure out an explanation for my own ghostly encounter. They said to forget the whole thing. But fate would not let me forget it, for as soon as I arrived back at my home I could feel the wind breath past me. And I could smell the smell of humidity. After opening the door, I quickly slammed it. And then outside the window ... ... I felt something staring at me from outside of the window. But I was not exactly sure what. It was a moment later that the feeling began to fade. I stared out the window.</p>

      <h2 id="leairportdetokyo">Le Airport De Tokyo</h2>
<p>Enlarged head syndrome. This was what the doctors diagnosed, when she had her cranium expanded, with biologically inert metallic plates holding her head together. Every now and then she still gets head aches, and the powders that she receives as part of airline maid training only does so much for her.</p>
<p>Initially Suzuki Marie did not have many chances to visit with the homeless looking girl, who would, despite being Anglophone and being of the age where people still spoke English, spoke a natural degree of Francaise, and a passable amount of Japanais. She never had many opportunities to talk with her directly, despite being a frequent flier on airports in which she would travel. One of the first words they exchanged were:</p>
<p>-- So where are you off to?</p>
<p>-- To the next airport to find a great airport.</p>
<p>-- But surely you have some specific place to go?</p>
<p>-- I suppose, although part of the fun of travel is observe how different places operate their flights. It helps that there is a lot of beautiful women, who attend the flights.</p>
<p>The manners of the flight attendant prevented her being able to ask whether the homeless girl found her to be attractive. She was unsure however why this specifically mattered, except that there was something about the woman that did not seem like other government support homeless people that would take flights. Her flights were to frequent, and therefore they would encounter each other to frequently. Plus, getting through different nations security systems did not seem like a pleasurable experience. With almost every country in the west having an extreme amount of steps to go through just to be deemed safe enough to travel the globe.</p>
<p>Rah Ebuma Ini Eneru, the bum in black. She would would be sleeping near the window, and sometimes not even requesting snacks, despite it not costing in an extra dime to tide one over.</p>
<p>-- Are you hungry Musa?</p>
<p>-- Nio, gehi ne fam piesa.</p>
<p>-- How do you make sure you are fed.</p>
<p>-- Me and friends I would meet would sometimes roast some coffee, and have Korean and Japanese barbecues outside. At other points I mostly just buy a salad and a beer.</p>
<p>Marie had gotten used to receiving to much information from her charge. But sometimes this would distract her from her duties, in which the head would sometimes lecture her for malpractice. However, knowing that it was the only way in which she could receive pain medication, which was enough to keep her completely abandoning her job, as this was even more important than food sometimes, she eventually would break it off, and Rah Ebuma Ini Eneru would would go back to sleep by the window, and read books about Left-Market Anarchism, and various currently released manga she kept on her electronic reader.</p>
<p>The nature of the bum's lifestyle preventing her from having a permanent home, because she wanted to maintain the illusion that she was rich enough to pay for various flights, but not enough to rent an extended stay hotel. Thus she would buy whatever books she wanted on her electronic reader. Eventually one of the airports in which she arrived had to take an extended flight delay. This gave the two time to exchange few more emotas.</p>
<p>-- I never got your name? Marie asked.</p>
<p>-- I rarely use my real name anymore. However, online I refer to myself as "that precious reader".</p>
<p>-- What would you read on your flights.</p>
<p>-- I would usually read manga currently released in Japan. She offered Marie a cigarette, but she waved it off. But I also sometimes beta reader fellow comic creators work.</p>
<p>-- I can't smoke, it gives me head aches.</p>
<p>-- From that beautifully large head of yours.</p>
<p>-- Pardon moi?</p>
<p>-- Desole. Didn't mean to offend.</p>
<p>-- No, I'm just sensitive about.</p>
<p>The Precious Reader gently placed her palms on her head. Suddenly all of the memories of Marie would come into her head. Marie would play different puzzles to expand her intelligence prowess, but at some point her brain started growing more rapidly than her skull could keep up. Eventually the doctors became involved in an emergency procedure to expand its size. But there was a chance that it may shorten her life.</p>
<p>-- So in order to live, they took a chance on you.</p>
<p>-- How did you know?</p>
<p>-- Lets just say, I have my way of things. But worry not. You're one of the more beautiful girls that I have ever met.</p>
<p>-- Is there somewhere you'd like to go next?</p>
<p>-- Isn't the flight delayed?</p>
<p>-- I mean here, at the "Airport De Tokyo".</p>
<p>-- I have time if you to.</p>
<p>-- All the time in the world.</p>

      <h2 id="melinadenoiretblanc">Melina De Noir Et Blanc</h2>
<p>In the cart to my death where I belong, give me the wet and ply dirt beneath my feet in my wooden clogs. In the cart to my death, where I belong, I see the dreadful climb towering above my little wooden sabot feet above me. The widow cut to bone through my skin, head tumbling down the oak basket. Blood pouring out, oblivion. I should have seen the Guillotine, with its Sombrero hat. While I lay after I have prayed, upon my belly fat. I masturbate long nights, and think of my poor Anienne who is still at large.</p>
<p>So much for Melina de noir et blanc.</p>
<p>When the crowd stared at me, they thought be profane. My blood down the drain. Only the flow of the loving guillotine was my solace, whom had descending from many evolutions of different decapitation devices. And generally, people were executed barefoot, except in the cases of the Aristocratic classes. But it was twenty one twenty seven, and a lot of things have changed since the year of seventeen ninety two. Now people's necks are put into the stock for execution, whom are rich enough for wooden clogs. I carried a small shotgun, while I was on the run; me and my boyfriend at the time were already battling rental debts. Anienne, my love, was the closest thing I could ever come to fulfilling my romantic desires.</p>
<p>I had developed the tendency to switch between white and black Lolita dresses, and I had especially painted two little wooden shoes, one painted white and black. I would dress in white when I went to Church, and in black when I wanted to lurk in Cyberspace, and play at the arcades with my Anienne. Who showed me how to play various shooter games at the arcade, while swooping upon my neck like a vulture, whom nips at me like a noir la chatte. And on days I would go see her, when her father was no home from work. We would scissor, and give each other blow jobs, but there was so much more than that.</p>
<p>Though I'd assume you'd rather not think of sensual things with the lady of the dead. One night we connected, and updated each other on our QR code blogs, while giving each other foot jobs with out wooden clogs. Climbing all the way to the tops of nipples. Eventually the necks connecting, under the glow of green energy lights, while think of guillotines, and Birkenstock sandals. Our bodies pulsating into ninth dimensional frequencies. Two birds of extreme anxiety, two birds who trust nobody else but each other.</p>
<p>But it would be one our last nights together.</p>
<p>But I still feel it in my dress.</p>
<p>Something one may never guess, I don't actually have a split personality. The reality is that nobody who does the sorts of things I do really does. I took an ax head to my husbands forehead, and felt a sense of coldness. Perhaps this cold sanity, was the real reason that I was sentenced to have my head cut off. Yet the idea of being decapitated, had always turned me on. Something that had always made Anienne curious. After all, how may one be turned on when they're merely a head. But I was right ahead of her, at light speed.</p>
<p>My interest had developed in childhood, but it was only recently that I had become open to the idea of being such a submission victim, in a game where the only role play partner was automatic and sharpened at full extent. My death would only ever be of my mom's lament, and my love was for nobody but my Anienne. And now, I see my body, whose head had been separated, and my head, that was placed on a stick outside the court house. The idea, despite being very much dead, still give my vagina the chills, and I cum.</p>
<p>I release.</p>
<p>Me and Anienne met each other at the arcade. Her real name was Anienne Nina Himaka, a product of a half Spanish half French mother, and a Japanese father. Her father had once punished for not performing at the family business quite to his expectations, but she got by with simply a scar tattoo. But her two little wooden shoes, was what drew me to her, because they had looked better on her than anyone else.</p>
<p>And the face, was a face of angels, who mated with the stars, yet her behavior was quite the contrary. Because she was no ordinary very, and in bed she was quiet extraordinary. But had always been something of a bad sport. Yet now I see her riding motorcycles, and shooting at rival Yakuza at different town sectors. It had been a perpetual manhunt, comparable to Geoffrey Amerada et other notorious mob bosses.</p>
<p>But because she was a girl, the police had a hard time apprehending her, as most people took her side in any particular dispute. Capturing her was a matter of force, even though everyone pretty much knew she murdered her father, but not in cold blood. She simply wanted to survive this strange new world they called Earth. And she dances, in her clogs, to classical Flamenco, and electro-pop jazz. While working at times as a prostitute.</p>
<p>And now I watched over my bride.</p>
<p>Despite that she had framed me.</p>
<p>When she was apprehended, it was a show trial. But it was mildly erotic, she liked to discuss her sexual exploits for various Japanese and French crime bosses, and would have to be silenced by the court of public approval, along with the criminal. But eventually she was sentenced to the dreadful climb like I.</p>
<p>And all I could think of was death.</p>
<p>The Seraphs wanted her and me together, and her losing her own head to its angular blade was simply a matter of time. But when she died, after the guillotine had sliced through her neck, she died with a smile on face, because she saw me in the clouds.</p>
<p>I reached out a hand to reach her.</p>
<p>And now me and her pulsate our bodies together, in electro-pop rhythm, while visiting aliens who abducts girls from their homes.</p>
<p>But for me, Melina De Noir Et Blanc, I have mine.</p>
<p>She who was of Japan and France.</p>

      <h2 id="mutualintelligibility">Mutual Intelligibility</h2>
<p>– So Korean is basically Japanese rotated 13 shifts?</p>
<p>– Of course not, why would you think that?</p>
<p>– Well I got that a Free Software Developer.</p>
<p>– Likely source.</p>
<p>Japan and Korea had been bitter enemies since world war II, although why this rivalry lasted to the immigration to America, this was not entirely clear. Sometimes you would find Japanese-Americans and Korean-Americans that still held that old sense of rivalry, despite near generation of millennial even knowing what the inside of a prison looks like, and not experiencing racism to the same degree other minorities did, unless of course you asked a leftist, in which exclusively the middle class white man was the one that experienced no discrimination and victimization.</p>
<p>In this way, both TERFs and the Far Left merged in this deceptively unlikely way. The Far Left and Far Right also merged in terms of the way they expected their adherents to take their ideology as if it were gospel. This was why the person that originally asked if Korean and Japanese had some mutual intelligibly, wondered what the real reason was she was called racist for even asking. It used to be you could ask whether Portuguese food was similar to Spanish food, and other things, and the only people that would get upset were first generation immigrants. This is why the programmer developed the theory that instead of genuine discrimination, the majority of Japanese-Americans and Korean-Americans, were simply being told to feel victimized by the far-left. This was why it was initially strange to her to find ones that believed in classical liberalism.</p>
<p>But given, in the past, people's tendency to vote against their own interests, this probably should have been much less of a surprise than it was. This was why it was incrediply hard to move toward the enlightened center, despite holding onto much of her far left wing values, like worker-coops, and so forth. She wanted to become a small business owner, but found that it was impossible to keep her professional and personal life separate on certain platforms, because Leftists kept harassing her online, with them not viewing a distinction. You would have leftists interrogating her about her loyalty to worker-cooperatives, and other stuff, while still trying to build an author brand. It eventually got to the point where she didn't even get peace for wanting to write about her experience with immigrants, despite the fact that leftist eventually became just as bad as leftists, creating a kind of new social hierarchy of victim-hood. For example, in recent months, with the creation of Chaz and Chop in Washington State, they began developing segregation zone between races organized by black people. She wondered then, whether she could even make a joke about Mexican girls being hot in Birkenstocks. Or Asian girls for that matter. Feeling constantly on edge, with people other than herself wanting to be the exclusive owners of ideological dogma, she left the political world with most of her old anxieties unnecessarily aggravated.</p>
<p>Even now, she refuses to use certain parts of the fediverse, because they still overly used the economy of victim hood, rather than genuine measures of worth and scale. So now all she could was talk about comics, and her old interest in Japanese-manga. But even with this the far-left has found something to complain about.</p>
<p>It's almost as if it weren't about persecution.</p>
<p>But rather finding reasons to be a victim.</p>
<p>Yet now here she was, dreaming about the desire to blow an apartment building, because it was populated by ex Free Software developers, with her asking them whether it was OK to speak Japanese, and not French, and when finding out they were Korean-immigrants, lectured about asking whether Japanese and Korean was mutually intelligible.</p>
<p>Nowhere was safe online.</p>
<p>It mattered not the topic.</p>

      <h2 id="mylifeasateenageratarobotsciencefare">My Life As A Teenager At A Robot Science Fare</h2>
<p>The skyline was paved with Smyrna roads, and pyramids double the size of the tallest Trump tower. Binary raining down from the sky in Neon Lime and Purple. Where the old Native America lands were, where I could repent for modernization, I could dump all my modern technology in my back yard, and run away from home and become part of my Cherokee tribe. This had always been my dream. Instead I'm left wondering why I live in this new city, now renamed merely a subdivision of .</p>
<p>I simply wanted a robot girlfriend.</p>
<p>Smyrna wasn't quite the same suburban neighborhood, by the time my sister invented age reversion therapy. By the time I turned thirty two, I had completed complete gender transition, and considered getting a degree as a computer science engineer. When I was visit my old town, I'd note how much it had grown into something closer to a city over the last decade, leaving to wonder if I accidentally stepped into a time machine, and didn't realize it. This was the story of an age reversion I thought was interesting at the time, and I suppose for the most part only left me reliving my high school years, in a much cheerier contextaroo.</p>
<p>I visited her one night, while she discussed some of the underlying issues of being able to make oneself look sixteen again.</p>
<p>– So, are you telling me? In theory mom and dad could make me look like a high school junior again? I asked, if you heard it, I'm not sure that you would believe it either. At the time I thought even the idea of aliens landing on my backyard was closer to the truth. – But what if people really think I'm actually sixteen?</p>
<p>– You can tolerate a few swats right?</p>
<p>– What do you mean by that?</p>
<p>– Well your face would finally match your maturity, I'm sure they wouldn't mind putting back in high school classes for the rest of the century.</p>
<p>Even as a teenager, I had dreamed of having immortality. Even if it wasn't quite in this context. I especially didn't want to go back to high school in my old suburban playground. Although it was matter than going back to being educated in Blackman High School. But the first few weeks after my therapy, my dream of secondary education was replaced with the genuine terror that I was legitimately being sent back to high school. While it wasn't quite someone's execution, in my mind it didn't feel much different.</p>
<p>But this was better than being an artificial Toddler, learning the beginnings of Lojban and sign language. And the few first month past by as if the school didn't really know my age. Technically you could say this was fraud, but I never had much of a voice in the family anyway. But at night I still listened to the flow of Japanese Flamenco, rendered from different Latin American countries. As my dreams faded to black.</p>
<p>The next morning, I was sent to the principles office, and all the staff was there to give me wild applause. I would have thought it was because I managed to fool them about my age.</p>
<p>– We've been watching your grades rise over the school year. It's all thanks to this science project you've been working on. Who knew that the formula for Artificial General Intelligence, was AGI = K^C. We've be producing robot high school girls in no time, at light speed.</p>
<p>I wasn't quite sure why the Principle wanted to do that.</p>
<p>But sometimes life could be like that, flowing meaningless down Purgatory as if it were a river of flames. And ones old wish turned against you, as your mind give up some of your old desires. Only to be able to have your desires congratulated for you at the speed of an executioner's ax. As she dreams of themselves climbing up at stair case, being tied to a board, lowered, and beheaded.</p>
<p>Instead I was back in my old body, and I called my sister up to ask why the age reversion therapy wore out.</p>
<p>– Are you smoking pot again?</p>
<p>– That's not how pot works OK!</p>
<p>– By the way, how's your robot project going?</p>
<p>I looked at my desk, and upon is was my science fare reward, and on the side was my on non software programmed robot girl, with Chia Pet grown hair. – It's going, she's right at my desk.</p>
<p>– Cool I'd like to see.</p>
<p>I wasn't sure if my mind was playing tricks on me, or if in fact I had already been back to high school, and it simply flowed so quickly, while I dreamed of girls with flowers in their hair, and soft guitar playing. While I could focus my life on my real desires again.</p>
<p>My cybernetic pixie dream girl.</p>
<p>Flowing like old tap dance.</p>

      <h2 id="pervertedwonderland">Perverted Wonderland</h2>
<p>The driveway was cold and wet, as her mother drove her into the school parking lot. She was left to walk into the school on her own, despite the rain. She carried a small umbrella. Her mom went to go park, then met up with her in the main hallway. Together, they toured the school. The university was largely quiet, for some illustration and animation lessons were still in session. One of the doors was open, and she met her eyes with a dark brunette hair colored girl. The school uniform was a yellow business casual tee shirt, skin tight blue jeans, and pair of dark brown Birkenstock clogs.</p>
<p>Her mom said she would see her at the end of year. The home room teacher, a young woman just ten years her senior, wearing what seemed more like an exercise suit one would wear at the beach, rather than what a business professional would wear.</p>
<p>– Get your portfolio ready.</p>
<p>Eventually she was shown her room after the school day, where she met up again with the girl she had first met in class. – Are you new here? Our new artist, the main character of this story, simply nodded her head. – I'm sure that I can force words out of you. She said pushing her lips closer to the new artist. – But for now I have an itch that needs scratched.</p>
<p>She the new student took off her yellow tee shirt. – Do you mind scratching my back for me? The new artist was slightly taken aback by this gesture, but was simply glad the hazing rituals was not any more than this. By night time the new artist offered to do a sketch of the girl in the yellow tee shirt. – Do you promise not to show anyone?</p>
<p>– Well I haven't shown anyone my portfolio.</p>
<p>– Oh wow, so you said something finally.</p>
<p>– I often don't have the energy for speech.</p>
<p>It was the next day that the girl in the yellow tee shirt returned the favor, and showed the new artist her portfolio after class. – So how did showing them your portfolio go for acceptance?</p>
<p>– Well to tell you the truth, they seemed surprised.</p>
<p>– Why would that be, your art seems tame.</p>
<p>– Well ... the school is an all girl's school, and they're not exactly what you would call progressive.</p>
<p>It was then that the girl that was her room mate had a smile on her face. – What is that suppose to mean? Our home room teacher is a giant hippie.</p>
<p>– Well sometimes look can be deceiving.</p>
<p>That night the artist had a dream that she was walking through the school gardens at night, floating in the wind. And she would imagine the statues converging n word on her. Until she realized she was looking at her friend's portfolio in her dorm, and trying not to touch herself. Because it was in this drawing that her room mate's sketch was wearing Birkenstock clogs, and it took a knock at a door for her to come back to her senses.</p>
<p>And outside the door, is the teacher.</p>
<p>– Hey, I saw that image in the portfolio.</p>
<p>– Sorry my...</p>
<p>– Don't worry about, we are good here. But I am curious, where did you get that idea from? It is perverted, and yet something that seems like it would be in a Disney film.</p>
<p>– It is part of a style I'm refining.</p>
<p>– What do you call it?</p>
<p>– Disney's Perverted Wonderland.</p>
<p>The artist thought that the teacher would try to ask her to live her home room, but instead things went way more smoothly than she expected. Thanks in no small part, do to an element of unethical teacher behavior. But not something that would normally merit bringing up to the principle. And the rest of the week was a little bit more of a breeze.</p>
<p>She dreamed of haunted gardens.</p>
<p>Gardens of wandering statues.</p>

      <h2 id="thedolphinslied">The Dolphin's Leid</h2>
<p>"Dolphin's Sonnet.
The mammal that squeeks in ocean.
Dolphin's sonnet,
once a human from world of
life, now a creature in dark.
Flippers from here to space.
Dolphin's sonnet."</p>
<p>The man with the black fedora said, as he snatch one more soul, lowering that thing once a human, into the plot. And into the abyss the corpse fell. It was another week of reaping corpses, this time a young girl who died of syphilis. And the previous weeks it was more of the same. And with his Dolphin mask, hopped onto his boat, and went into the world of the dead. The dolphin man in black living in a house that floated in an underground lake, and above was a graveyard in the style the French had brought over when that had colonized the US. Every time there was a new resident, the new one would morph into a humanoid form, and into a dolphin with a wolf's face. Their primary diet being grey scaled rabbits that would hop out of the underground lakes. Some say these pointed ear fish are what remains of previous pets, with few pets remaining in their origins forms once they acclimate to a life underground.</p>
<p>The man in the Dolphin suit always dreaded traveling in the catacombs of stalagmites, that would hover menacingly above the lake, looming over as if they might drop and penetrate those swimming below at any moment. For despite being no longer of the world of the living, Dolphin Wolves were still made of fleshed, and nobody liked to be the mess that some other fin would have to clean up, until they can eventually regain their shape. Between graveyard it was often only three years in actual time, but the swim made it feel like it would take a day and half. And time passed slower underground than on the surface, where a black cat awaited those who visit the graveyard for one last time. In ages past, scientists speculated there were oceans on the moon, but this was innaccurate. It was a misremembering of when they had previously been dead and in Dolphin form, where they could recall the many tunnels of H20 that connected various cities. It was a time when man still believed in flying space zombies, never considering the idea of mortality being more of a transitionary state:</p>
<p>"One persons ashes,
Two persons long misery.
Eternal darkness."</p>
<p>It was the Dolphin man's job, with his black fedora, and his distressed leather coat, to lead those of stinky bloat, to where they can take on new form so that the transition between life to another life can continue to take its natural course. And when he visited one of the graveyards, in Chattanooga, Tennessee, he recalled two girls playing jump rope, despite that fact that most normal people of their age, would avoid the place. But without parents to take care of them, this was as close to having a home as they could ever get. So he never bothered taking them to the world of connected lakes and mine shafts, but he would find a rabid coal miner that would attempt to attack his guests with a pick ax, and they were often the most difficult to fend off. But it was made easier by the fact that Dolphin Man was the one person that could not transition to new lives, and simply remain in a constant state somewhere between human, wolf, and dolphin. And once his mask was taken off, this would quickly reduce the deranged mine workers into trembling messes.</p>
<p>The last girl that he had reaped, was the second to the last, and he was curious how the girl would handle being the only one left, ever sense the death of both of their parents on the surface world. Old Hollywood movies never went that far into the decomposition process, and as far as most mortals knew, humans would slowly melt the flesh off their bones, which would be the only bits of matter that is left, besides the ones that opted to be cremated. The ones that kept their bodies in tact were able to reincarnate, and be reborn into new bodies, but those who became ashes, would wonder as floated Myst under the Earth for eternity. Some opted to become permanently crystalized, but when dumped it all goes to essentially the same place. And without a body to tell the craftsman who the myst is, it was a guess to find what out what family lineage the mysted ones belonged to, and thus it could be many decades of aimless searching, just to find out the right family to rebirth the spirit into. Assuming they ever get reborn at all.</p>
<p>This was one of those girls, whose voice echoed throughout the mine shafts, and would drift up into the graveyard at night.</p>
<p>But the girl, whom the Dolphin Man knows only as "Madam Myst", would help and guide his passage through the lakes, when he could barely see. And it was this that the Dolphin man came to wander into the next graveyard, with no clear task for the evening, and running into the one remaining child that continued to be alive despite the passing of her girlfriend. The girl, presumably now sixteen, dressed not to dissimilar from the man in the fedora, with a Dolphin man.</p>
<p>"I've seen this wreched face before,
This face that I have once adored.
After the moonlight, you take people away.
And yet I remain here to see you." said she.</p>
<p>"You need not fear me, for we have met before.
Your friend died with no pain,
And talks fondly of you.
From her guiding finger, to her windy snore."</p>
<p>The young girl, illuminated by the glow of the lamp light, walked closer to the Dolphin man.</p>
<p>"Dolphin's Sonnet.
The mammal that squeaks in ocean.
Dolphin's sonnet,
once a human from world of
life, now a creature in dark.
Flippers from here to space.
Dolphin's sonnet." said the Dolphin man.</p>
<p>"Why not take me,
To the world of dolphin's leid?
So I can hold her."</p>
<p>And with that, he remembered why it was he never bothered to reap this one spirit. Whom would hang out at the graveyard every night, from sundown to moonlight. From the pain of wooden shoes, to her unkempt hair, he found there was no pleasure in taking someone so young and beautiful. Whom had still very much of a life to live. For the Dolphin man, this was somewhat unusual, as normal he shed no tears for the living, either do to be old enough to come with him, or being murderers. But for this girl, her only sin was to visit her girlfriend's plot by midnight.</p>
<p>"You look like you've barely eaten dear".</p>
<p>"And what have you to offer me?"</p>
<p>"I have these."</p>
<p>"But doesn't your kind not eat mortal food?"</p>
<p>"Well I'm not entirely mortal or immortal."</p>
<p>The girl took the snacks graciously, and then stared up at the Dolphin man.</p>
<p>"Where do you go, after your job is done?"</p>
<p>"To a land of a thousand rivers."</p>
<p>"That sound absolutely beautiful."</p>
<p>"It is my dear, but it is not your time yet. But once it's up, we all go to this land of rivers. And was we decompose, we become like Dolphins in the ocean. And wolves in the forest. And those will eventually be reborn. But your girlfriend..."</p>
<p>"You said she went smoothly."</p>
<p>"Yes, but she was cremated. At tradition from the East Coast US brought from Japan. Yet it creates issues when guiding spirits to their new life."</p>
<p>"Is there anything I can do?"</p>
<p>"Well there is one way, but those who come might never return."</p>
<p>"It's not like I have anything to lose."</p>
<p>And with this she took his guiding hands.</p>
<p>And sung the Dolphin's Leid.</p>

      <h2 id="thegirlwiththeshovel">The Girl With The Shovel</h2>
<p>Two moons hung over the horizon in a white fog on a Charcoal black sky.</p>
<p>I had just woken up at the rest stop in an empty part of town, not knowing exactly where I was. In the back of my mind, I saw a girl with black hair, reaching out for help as the bus drove through the flooded dirt road, to reach the turn at the rest stop. It had occurred to me that I didn't have my backpack on hand, and all I had on me was my wallet with my ID in my shoulder bag, with a few zines to sell while looking for a ride out of town and back to Chattanooga. I purchased a few snacks to tide me over while waiting for the next bus to arrive. But as it turned out, that would be the last bus for many months. I set at a table outside, waiting for the rain to stop.</p>
<p>I needed to find a map of some sort in the lobby, in the off chance that I needed to refer to that if I needed to walk back home, in case no ride was available. Once I retrieved it, I began my trip along the ledge of the road. The cars would pass by, and the wind would gust right over me. The rain however stopped. It was dark, and I had to carry around the flash light that was on my smartphone I was carrying. On my phone, I would receive odd text messages from someone who seemed to know me really well, but I had only known from a few trips. She would sit on the back of the bus when we would go to school together. I was one of the few that would sit come sit by her side, with her black hair over her eyes, pretending as if not to notice me. I would ask the others what her deal was, and said that ever sense her little brother died, she had not spoken a word. Only sat silently in the back of the bus. We only knew each other on the bus, and had largely different class periods. But one day, she asked me: "Do you have a little brother?"</p>
<p>"Not anymore" I said. This was not entirely true, however it would have been to much to go into why my siblings no longer lived with me. "I heard you miss your brother."</p>
<p>"Lets not mention him again."</p>
<p>I wasn't sure why she was contacting me now, except that perhaps she might have been asking me where I was, so her family could offer me a ride back to Chattanooga. Eventually I saw a car slow down, with its headlights on. When the door opened, I saw her family. "Are you lost? You can come stay with us for the evening." I had no other choice, and I wasn't about to freeze to death in the wind, with the rain on the horizon.</p>
<p>"Yes please, and thank you." I said.</p>
<p>"Tonight, we'll be having hamburgers and hot dogs. Do you have a favorite topping?" the mother asked. What I had noticed was that the black haired girl was not in the car.</p>
<p>"I'm a hot sauce girl." I said.</p>
<p>The mother had made my bed for me, and I thanked her for her generosity. "It had been rather lonely here sense our daughter has been gone. It be a shame if you could stay here longer, and keep me company." I wasn't entirely sure how to take the comment.</p>
<p>After the lights went out for the evening, I heard the wind outside the window howl. Soon I tried to sleep. However I was woken up grown beside my face. I jolted up, and found that nobody was there. Then suddenly I saw the silhouette of a long haired girl in a white dress peeking through the door.</p>
<p>"Is that you? Was there something you needed?" I asked.</p>
<p>But there was silence.</p>
<p>What I would find out was that this town had had a murderer that was on the loose, that took her daughter. However a part of me wondered if that was only part of the story. The murderer was eventually tried, and given lethal injection last month. But some say his spirit still wanders around town, searching for victims for his ax.</p>
<p>When I woke up, I thought the lady would offer me a ride home. However she was no longer in the house. Instead I would here constant creaking in the hallways. Until eventually, I saw the silhouette again flicking just outside of my vision outside the kitchen window. I got my bags packed, when she supplied me with a new backpack and notebook paper, and $50 dollars in my pocket. I would have thought that she would at least give me a farewell. I parted ways with the house, and then began walking back into downtown Chattanooga. Instead it was night time, as if the morning had not passed.</p>
<p>Shuffling behind a dumpster, I found the silhouette of the girl. However she was not the woman that took me in, but rather a black haired girl, with hair over her face. She carried a shovel, and was covered in blood.</p>
<p>"I remember when I found my brother here." she said.</p>
<p>"Where have you been, you weren't in--" I began to say.</p>
<p>"Don't act like anything hasn't changed between us."</p>
<p>She began lurching toward me with her shovel.</p>
<p>On the run, I found I had to hide at the next town over. I wasn't sure when the girl was going to find me. In the library, I found a historical newspaper rack. On it detailed the exact circumstances of the previous murders. There had been considerable doubt about the guilt of him, and some had speculated that the real murderer may actually still be on the loose. I couldn't help but wonder if it was this girl I met that committed the murders. The house had in fact been abandoned by the family, and they were about to tear the house down. Then I remembered something important.</p>
<p>A detail I did not pay attention to before: she said that her daughter was dead, and yet here was she was standing upright, lurching at me with her the shovel she was carrying.</p>
<p>Now I find myself trapped in this library, with nowhere else to go. Currently I'm looking for some doorway exit that I can break out of. I had stayed so long that I forgot the library closed.</p>
<p>I found a door, and broke it down with an ax.</p>
<p>Then booked a stay in the hotel.</p>
<p>I heard a grown and a scream in the bathroom, I struggle to make myself check to see what it is. Somehow I had left the lights on, but I thought I had turned those off.</p>
<p>I forgot to get my ax I purchased.</p>
<p>Opening the door, I saw her face in the mirror.</p>
<p>"Wait, how did you get here!?"</p>

<h2 id="ehenassilentlunch">Ehenas Silent Lunch</h2>

<p>"Mes nom es Ehena, et je suis moite Francais." It was one of those classroom introductions, that left students not sure what the other half was. Even when US society moved past discrimination, the way some students introduce themselves makes you wonder we do ourselves any favors. And I was no exception.</p>

<p>"So what's the other half?" anoher student said.</p>

<p>"I'm a Hafu, what would you think?"</p>

<p>Although in retrospect, my name would not have been an indicator, as my last name was Marie. My father, a Frenchmen was extremely traditional to a fault. And this included things like having my mom change her last name to be in accordance with the name of mes pere. Although all this was for naught now, but I'm cutting ahead of myself.</p>

<p>I am currently seventeen, although my family had moved from France back when I was thirteen. The first think people notice about me is my height, which is on the taller side of short. Which puts me almost as tall as a short male, despite being non transgendered. This is in contrast with my girlfriend, Hemato-Tomato, whom presents female, in as much as a tomboy with an overgrown bob that's dyed black can do so.</p>

<p>When we had started dating, I wasn't sure if she liked me as a person, or liked me for my footwear choices. To me specific, while most girls would wear high heels, I would be wearing ripped blue skinny jeans and Birkenstock Boston clogs. This had previously not been an issue in other schools I went to, but for whatever reason I often notice her starring at my shoes. But so far she hadn't acted out in anyway, despite how nervous she makes me feel. Although sometimes on formal occasions, my father would make me wear 1950s dresses, when I would rather go hiking in quarries. But would always stick it him but wearing my wood colored steel toe boots. And after mom died, as long as I did the minimum, he was never otherwise super pushy.</p>

<p>But that boils down my personality; I am conformist for the most part, except for some features where I try to make it obvious I'm not going to dance to other people's pop music. Like someone sitting along in a dark alleyway outside the soda fountain near the bookstore.</p>

<p>To think that it took meeting a deviant to break me out of my own routine.</p>

<p>Even if she seems she liked my slender goose neck over other aspects of my body.</p>

<p>It was another day of silent lunch, when I would regular sit with my girlfriend Hemato-Tomato. Normally she would ord two pizza, a hamburger without toppings besides cheese, and one bottle of water. Yet she never seemed to consume carbonated drinks. I was mostly the same way, except that sometimes I might bring a thermos of hot tea, to have along with my bento box.</p>

<p>It had been several weeks sense we had to have “silent lunch”, a form of punishment for the entire classroom, where the one mistake for one student would have ramifications for the life of all the rest of the students. Those who bring this silence would never be seen again.</p>

<p>There was one girl that broke this silence, and security guard jerked her by the neck, and took away from the cafeteria. The room that they would be taken off to was mysteriously called “Salle De Mort.” So far I’ve been lucky, as me and Hemato only exchange whispers.</p>

<p>But sometimes I wonder, what if it ends up the next day I end up being snatched, and how would my girlfriend feel about me being gone? I’m not sure I want to know what’s in “Salle De Mort”.</p>

<p>The halls of death.</p>

<p>The halls where none return from.</p>

<p>After I returned to school the next morning, the girl that disappeared into “Salle De Mort” never to class. I had just assumed that she was having a sick day, until I was invited outside by my girlfriend Hemato, the tomato.</p>

<p>“Hey I have something to show you.” Hemato said.</p>

<p>“I’m not sure if I really want to know.” I responded.</p>

<p>“It’s not bad, I promise. It kind of smells nice.”</p>

<p>I go over, and look inside the bag. There, to my horror, was the severed head of the girl that never returned to class.</p>

<p>“Hemato, how do you get this? You should put it back.”</p>

<p>“Can you promise to keep a secret?”</p>

<p>“I can try my best, can’t make...”</p>

<p>“I work as assistant executioner for my dad.”</p>

<p>“So where ‘Salle De Mort’ go?”</p>

<p>“That’s where students who violated code of silence in the...”</p>

<p>“I thought they stopped doing that in 81 in my home country?”</p>

<p>“Times have changed a bit sense then.”</p>

<p>I try to convince myself that this was some sort of practical joke, that Hemato was not really holding the severed head of one of my classmates, and that she didn’t really work as an executioner in “Salle De Mort”.</p>

<p>“So how did you get to work in that room?”</p>

<p>“I don’t, I’m a friend of the kid that does. I work for the government.”</p>

<p>“Then how did you get that?”</p>

<p>“You think I got around digging up graves? I was able to bribe him into letting me have it, sense they were just going to cremate her body anyway.”</p>

<p>“And why do you keep them?”</p>

<p>“If I told you, I’d have to kill you. And I want you badly.”</p>

<p>I wasn’t quite sure how to feel about Hemato-Tomato. I wasn’t sure if she was even telling the truth, and I wasn’t sure why death somehow the justified punishment for those whom broke the “code of silence”.</p>

<p>The silence in the school had been something implemented for off and on for a long time, but it never occurred to me that there would be deadly implications for principles pursuit of “justice”, if you can ever call it that.</p>

<p>And now, here I was, dating someone, with no idea what her real interests are in.</p>

<p>Am I somehow merely a severed head to her?</p>

<p>It was one of those school days, where you’re never really quite sure how to respond to your girlfriend, when she says something that’s disturbing. Do enough complaining, and eventually undo attention will be drawn to yourself.</p>

<p>“Have you ever smelled it Ehena?” Hemato asked.</p>

<p>“Smell what?” I responded.</p>

<p>It was midnight, I heard the closet door creak. I thought I had killed that bastard. But it became quickly apparent that what I was dealing with some something not quite human, and yet not quite beast. I went to go check the halls, as he was still lying on the floor in a bloody mess, which I had to clean up. It was something I didn’t want Hemato-Tomato to know about me, so when with would have lunch together, I would just tell her that I would prefer not to talk about my family.</p>

<p>When I went to go back to bed I heard a voice.</p>

<p>“Ehena, I know what you have done.” the voice said. It’s voice matching an altogether different form of resonance than what would pass for humans.</p>

<p>“Who are you, hiding in my closet. Is that you Hemato?”</p>

<p>“Hemato does not know about your misdeed. But I can help you cover it up, if you can do one favor.”</p>

<p>I struggled to come up with a firm decision.</p>

<p>Then I made up my mind.</p>

<p>Outside in the midnight forest, where the shadows trees is illuminated by the glow of wolves eyes at night, you would think that there would not be many beast that humans have not yet conquered, yet here I was helping this girl, who had once been a bear like thing, find the Ursine that had murdered her in battle. I carried around a compass made from the bones of her previous enemies, and wished that all this would soon come to an end.</p>

<p>But at last, I had find the bear that took her life.</p>

<p>And at once, the girl in Silhouette morphed into this thing, shaped not quite like a bear, and giant bat like creature, with fans that can crush human bones. And I almost blacked out thinking that it would strike me.</p>

<p>But instead it bit the head off of another that bear that killed it so long ago.</p>

<p>The creature morphed back into the girl in silhouette. She had began to take on the form of my sisters back in France, whom I had stopped having a closer relationship, and wasn’t sure if they would even move to the US.</p>

<p>“I thought you had been in France.” I said.</p>

<p>“Do I look like someone you know Ehena?”</p>

<p>I woke up in my bed, as if it had all been merely a dream within a dream, a nightmare within a nightmare. Yet when I looked at my closet, it was dripping with a fowl stench of blood that was not quite human.</p>

<p>But something entirely different.</p>

<p>It seemed my sister was a bear-bat.</p>

<p>Le Kumabatto De L’Goules.</p>

<p>“I could make a sweetheart deal with you” said the ghoul.</p>

<p>“But people say that I have no soul.” said Ehena.</p>

<p>“I know someone with a soul when I see one.”</p>

<p>“What are you offering?”</p>

<p>“Before I died, I know that our father wasn’t the great.”</p>

<p>“What are you suggesting?”</p>

<p>“I can give you the better to remove him from your life forever.”</p>

<p>When my father was around, he would barely pay attention to me, except when he was having one of his fits of rage. The few times I would see him would be when we would have dinner together, and it was fairly regularly are rather quiet household. But this figure, that reminded me of my older sister, whom had gone missing back when I was still living in France, was offering me something that was extremely tempting.</p>

<p>“But what would we do with his body?”</p>

<p>“I can offering you a chest, and you can lock him in there.”</p>

<p>“Why have you returned to this world?”</p>

<p>“I have unfinished business with one of my foes.”</p>

<p>At at one, pushing me onto the ground, with me reaching out to try to prevent falling, I saw her body begin to morph. Her jaw line began to extend, her eyes became glowing red, like the faint glimmer of coral reefs. And she grew an extra three feet in height, with her body completely in fur, with her silhouette illuminated by the glow of the fireflies in the midnight forest.</p>

<p>“What are you, you’re not my sister.”</p>

<p>“I had once been your sister.”</p>

<p>The thing, that didn’t look like other types of bears, bolted into the forest. With a deep growl that reverberated through the forest.</p>

<p>It was the next morning, and I woke up with the texture of leaves in my bed. I looked inside my closet, and found, to my horror, those glowing red eyes, those of that thing that had once been my deer sister, but had become something else.</p>

<p>I had sold my soul to my dead sister.</p>

<p>But now it was time for school.</p>

<p>I went outside during lunch break to visit with Hemato-Tomato after school. Here, while reclining on the school wall her, I asked “Hey Hemato, are you actually that one thing that keeps visiting me in my closet?”</p>

<p>“What do you mean Ehena?” Hemato asked.</p>

<p>“Well I’ve been visited by this weird thing, a shadow figure, that would I almost describe as bear shaped. However, when I look into its eyes, it get the hint that it’s something altogether to human.”</p>

<p>“Well there is this phenomenon called Shadow people. Have you heard of them?”</p>

<p>“Isn’t that usually a result of sleep paralyses?”</p>

<p>“Well it certainly can be, but not always. I used to be visited by them as well. Although I never recalled specifically being visited by a bear like thing.”</p>

<p>“What did you see?”</p>

<p>“It was more like this man in a black trench coat, and a top hat. He would carry around a cane, and seem as if to hop out of time.:</p>

<p>But if us seemed to be equally perplexed about what we saw, as in both cases there simply wasn’t a rational explanation for what we witnessed. It suppose it’s suppose on those nights, after I stabbed my father, I would experience sleep paralyses, and had trouble with sleeping sense I was very young. As far back as I could remember.</p>

<p>I was hesitant to discuss more about what I witnessed, thus said made my farewell. And at that point, I wasn’t sure if I would ever see my girlfriend again.</p>

<p>“Somebody cut the grandma out of the TV pilot.” It was one of those things someone who lives solely to watch midnight sitcoms would say, after a day at work. Father seemed to exclusively care about the nuances about why a show might cut the grandma out of a TV sitcom. He seemed blissfully unaware of the fact that he would make my life comparable to that, and not in a positive way. As if my very existence was a joke to him. “You see, a lot of people think she was the main character of show to begin, and now they switched completely to having the grandpa be the main lead”.</p>

<p>There was some controversy that came out years later, that got upset about the direction the sitcom was taking, and wanted no part about how the show was going down. She was the one that was made to look like the bad guy for the fact that the character was made to dress like a girl from the Netherlands. Despite the social taboos that were present at the time, and the internet becoming a wave of cancel culture, targeting of minorities whom often wrote such scripts.</p>

<p>But I never had that option to simply bow out of a TV script, as my whole life was like a badly written sitcom going fast forward, with no real off button, flowing infinitely in one direction with no stop in sight.</p>

<p>My life was a badly written musical.</p>

<p>And everyone else was screeching besides me.</p>

<p>“Ehena, I have come to bring you to hell with me”, a shambling corpse that had once been Ehena’s father</p>

<p>“I didn’t want to be around you in life, do you expect me to want to be around you in the after life?”</p>

<p>I woke up in my bed, with the door to my closet ajar, as if something had been in there waiting for me inside. Instead as I peeked within, there was nothing there. Except I could here the voice of the beast that offered to take his soul for me. My relationship with him had not been quite the same after mom died back in France, so it was only a matter of time until I declared my independence.</p>

<p>Part of my dream was that the casket had crumbled into dust, but as soon as I walked up the stairs in my birkenstocks, I found that the casket for which I had kept him remained. I struggled to think about what I should do with his body, as the blood for which I slit his throat was still fresh.</p>

<p>I could here the door banging, while I waited paralyzed an unable to move, with a S.W.A.T team outside the window.</p>

<p>I had no idea how exactly they had found out that I live alone, as I don't have family in France I'm close enough to come take me home. However when I had upstairs to check on the family chest, inside was the stabbed body of my father, and I could see the shadow figure looming in the shadows that taunted me while it slowed returned into its bear like form.</p>

<p>"You had done well to defend me while in my human form, and you have my thanks. But for now I shall leave you". said Kumabatto.</p>

<p>"But where where will you go in the future?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Somewhere fear away, to visit another human in need. Are you sure you don't want to come with me?"</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid for what the state might do to me."</p>

<p>"You know you'll be guillotined?"</p>

<p>"C'est le vie, mes vie en rose."</p>

<p>And with that, the bear-bat faded into another dimension.</p>

<p>I could here the S.W.A.T coming up the stairs, and took out my butcher knife. I stood by the side of the attic entrance, and waited to strike. When the first came, the made with the AK47 never knew what hit him. Then suddenly I blacked out, and woke up in a sterile prison cell. Here, I could see the sound of a guillotine blade dropping in the execution room.</p>

<p>A man in shadows came to my door, knocked, and said: "It is Ehena."</p>

<p>I am blind folded, and lead to a room strapped onto a table. The executioner removed the fold once my neck was locked in.</p>

<p>I could see my own reflection in the mirror, of my body locked in the guillotine. With the fading sound of the "ice cream changes" playing on the radio, that morphed into a black metal band.</p>

<p>My last fading vision is an angular blade slamming down on my neck.</p>

<p>Then my head starring at the blade, dripping with blood.</p>

<p>“The smell of those particular types of fumes. The smell of burning corpses, the total incineration of human remain.”</p>

<p>It wasn’t the usual kind of conversation, where people would simply talk about what was going on during their day, we simply didn’t have that kind of relationship. Me and Hemato-Tomato, trusted either other for emotional support, that it seemed like nobody else was giving. I didn’t know much about what was going on in her family life, but she would always make remarks like these that would make me wonder what exactly she did after school hours.</p>

<p>“I had never considered the idea.”</p>

<p>“It’s nice, although I’m not sure how useful it is compared to using charcoal to make drawing ink.”</p>

<p>I resisted the tempted to want to hurl out my insides. And knowing Hemato’s oddities, I wasn’t sure if she would get a kick out of my temporary misery and illness. And it wasn’t like I had more functional people to spend my time with, as the type of country that US had evolved into, meant that there wasn’t many people whom would opt to hang out with a French immigrant.</p>

<p>Even among Japanese immigrants, there wasn’t that many whose father came from France. They might be able to relate to not being able to talk in he Japanese language, but they wouldn’t understand specifically why I would know Francais better than Nihongo.</p>

<p>And because of that, we would hang out after school, as outsiders, while she would fantasize about turning people’s corpses into ashes.</p>

<p>Ashes to ashes, rust to dust.</p>

<p>Mes vie, le Ehena de mort.</p>

<p>I observe Hemato-Tomato grieving on my severed head from the clouds in the sky, and I come down as if to hold Hemato in a final embrace. And yet something feels different about her, as she can’t seem to let go on the severed head that belonged to my corpse.</p>

<p>“Humans, how they take things for granted. Use minorities like playthings; those of us whom live by day, and sleep by night. And those whom browse the city streets looking for a fight. And yet if I must kill, then I must kill everyone. Every last human, till this there is nothing of left on this Earth.”</p>

<p>I am trapped in this mortal coil, with no proper way to pass on to the after life. Instead I here the voice of a man reading me a bed time story, while my severed head is plugged into a recovery tank.</p>

<p>It is because of her affection, that I cannot pass on.</p>

<p>For I am not merely a memory, but her desire for revenge.</p>

<h2 id="thepianointheward">The Piano In The Ward</h2>

<p>I see him walking outside my cell, he wishes me well. Outside the cell I hear him singing, With a sound like Church bells wringing, down the hall, my ear stinging. Stinging, as I recoil in my padded cell. In my padded cell, I dream of voices calling my name. And at night I hear a piano playing two chords, but not that of the devil’s tune. At had once been a girl with her life forward from the worlds long concerns. Now I feel stuffed in an urn, now sleeping. Sleeping until the angular blade comes for my turn.</p>

<p>In the hall I see the glimmer of a needle, while he laughs like a beetle. The beetle unleashing a thousand curses. Locked here in my untimely containment, the lawyer took many a coin from a purse. And yet, somehow how I feel that it is all for naught. Outside the door is a constant chord progression, notes that go ding dong in my sleep. And in this dream are many rolling heads from the angular blade, inside the courtyard. At night, in the hall, I see the spirits of the decapitated running through its depths. The doctor is a singing in a room, where I know not to go; and even if I could perhaps I am but mad. And yet the doctor’s laughs, his singing, and tormented keyboard tune splits my neck in two, more than the guillotine in the courtyard of “gargoyals”.</p>

<p>I call them gargoyals, but that’s not the truth. In fact they severed heads on sticks, placed by the armed guards at the gates. The thought of which inducing a fear-like orgasm mixed with the screams of beluga whales under the sea. Come stormy sea, sail me away from this prison near the sea. The severed heads are actually plaster encasings, the real heads kept inside tanks, until their brains are uploaded into a massive network. They say that is actually what it inside the building by the death penalty prison, and the psychiatric hospital.</p>

<p>When we visit the courtyard, the blood is barely cleaned dried off the straw, from the last wooden shoe wearing maid, who fell by the angular blade. Her bloody neck the object of fear and orgasm between the warden and the doctor, and apathy by those contained in building number one. But they say those who are cured of their mental illness will eventually also meet the blade. I find myself masturbating to the thought of severed maids of honor. But this thought goes away as I think of all the broken keys that fell off the piano, and the hangman’s nooses from the empty cell that have not been filled.</p>

<p>I have met the doctor, who wants me to prove that I am cured enough to be released. To play the keyboard at night, with all his ghoulish delight, so I can say goodnight.</p>

<p>“Those are not ghosts my dear, but uploaded mind. Would you like to become an uploaded mind?” the doctor asked.</p>

<p>I now enjoy my release, staring into the angular blade from the basket. My otherwise perfect vision fades to black.</p>

<p>The church bell rings.</p>
